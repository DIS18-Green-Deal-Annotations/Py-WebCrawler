      <p class="NormalWeb">
        <span> The Fit for 55 package consists of a set of </span>
        <span> inter-connected proposals, </span>
        <span>
          which all drive towards the same goal of ensuring a fair, competitive
          and green transition by 2030 and beyond. Where possible existing
          legislation is made more ambitious and where needed new proposals are
          put on the table. Overall, the package strengthens eight existing
          pieces of legislation and presents five new initiatives, across a
          range policy areas and economic sectors: climate, energy and fuels,
          transport, buildings, land use and forestry.

          The legislative proposals are backed by impact assessment analysis,
          which takes into account the interconnection of the overall package.
          The analysis shows that an over-reliance on strengthened regulatory
          policies would lead to unnecessarily high economic burdens, while
          carbon pricing alone would not overcome persistent market failures and
          non-market barriers. The chosen policy mix is therefore a careful
          balance between
