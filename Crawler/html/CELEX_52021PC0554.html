Furthermore, it aims to protect the health and well-being of citizens from environment-related risks and impacts. The necessity and value of the European Green Deal have only grown in light of the very severe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health and economic well-being of the Union’s citizens.</span>

                  <span>Based on a comprehensive impact assessment, the </span><span>Commission’s</span><span> Communication of 17 September 2020 on </span><span>Stepping up </span><span>Europe’s</span><span> 2030 climate ambition</span><span class="FootnoteReference">

                  </span><span> proposed to raise the EU</span><span>’</span><span>s ambition and put forward a comprehensive plan to increase the European Union</span><span>’</span><span>s binding target for 2030 towards at least 55% net emission reduction, in a responsible way. Raising the 2030 ambition now helps give certainty to policymakers and investors, so that decisions made in the coming years do not lock in emission levels inconsistent with the EU</span><span>’</span><span>s objective to be climate neutral by 2050. The 2030 target is in line with the Paris Agreement objective to keep the global temperature increase to well below 2</span><span>°</span><span>C and pursue efforts to keep it to 1.5</span><span>°</span><span>C.</span>
               </p>
               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>The Communication proposes to move towards a more stringent contribution from the LULUCF sector and, as a further step, to combine the agriculture non-CO</span><span>2</span><span> greenhouse gas emissions with the land use, land use change and forestry sector, thereby creating a newly regulated land sector (covering emissions and removals from agriculture, forestry and other land use). This can promote synergies between land-based mitigation actions and enable more integrated policymaking and policy implementation at the national and EU level. The analysis underpinning the Communication shows that the land sector would have the potential to become climate-neutral by around 2035 in a cost-effective manner, and subsequently generate more CO</span><span>2</span><span> removals than greenhouse gas emissions. </span>
               </p>
               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>The European Council endorsed the new EU binding target for 2030 at its meeting of December 2020</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                     <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref5" href="#footnote5">4</a>
                  </span><span>. It also called on the Commission “</span><span>to assess how all economic sectors can best contribute to the 2030 target and to make the necessary proposals, accompanied by an in-depth examination of the environmental, economic and social impact at Member State </span><span>level, taking into account national energy and climate plans and reviewing existing flexibilities</span><span>”.</span>
               </p>
               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>To this end, the </span><span>European Climate Law</span><span> makes the </span><span>EU’s</span><span> climate neutrality target legally binding, and raises the 2030 ambition by setting the target of at least 55% net emission reduction by 2030 compared to 1990. </span>
               </p>
               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>In order to follow the pathway proposed in the European Climate Law, and deliver this increased level of ambition for 2030, the Commission has reviewed the climate and energy legislation currently in place that is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2030 and by 60% by 2050.</span>
               </p>
               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>This </span><span>‘Fit for 55’ </span><span>legislative package, as announced in the Commission's Climate Target Plan, is the most comprehensive building block in the efforts to implement the ambitious new 2030 climate target, and all economic sectors and policies will need to make their contribution. </span>
               </p>
               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>The initial regulatory framework for the land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector, as laid down in Regulation (EU) 2018/841, was adopted in 2018 and covers CO</span><span>2</span><span> emissions and removals and greenhouse gas emissions of CH</span><span>4</span><span> and N</span><span>2</span><span>O resulting from the management of land, forests and biomass during the period from 2021 to 2030. It contributes to the previous Union’s emission reduction target of at least 40% by 2030 compared to 1990, by ensuring that the sum of total emissions does not exceed the sum of total removals generated by the sector after the application of the accounting rules and of the flexibility with the “effort sharing” (or ESR) sector set out by Regulation (EU) 2018/842.</span>
               </p>
               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>The proposal to amend Regulation (EU) 2018/841 as part of the ‘Fit for 55’ package aims to strengthen the contribution of the LULUCF sector to the increased overall climate ambition for 2030. To this end, the proposal: sets out the overall Union target of net greenhouse gas removals in the LULUCF sector to 310 million tonnes of CO</span><span>2</span><span> equivalent in 2030; reinforces the obligation for Member States to submit integrated mitigation plans for the land sector and enhances monitoring requirements using digital technologies; aligns the objectives with related policy initiatives of biodiversity and bioenergy; determines the Union target of climate neutrality for 2035 in the land sector (which combines the LULUCF sector and the non-CO</span><span>2</span><span> agricultural sector); and commits the Commission to make proposals for national contributions to the 2035 target by 2025. </span>
               </p>
               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>The proposed amendment introduces only minor, non-substantive, changes in the LULUCF regulatory framework for the first compliance period, i.e. from 2021 to 2025. In contrast, significant change takes place with the beginning of the second compliance period from 2026 to 2030. In order to simplify implementation and compliance, the Kyoto-inspired land accounting rules will no longer be applied post 2025, and the flexibility between LULUCF and with the “effort sharing” sectors will be adjusted, in line with the European Climate Law. The overall Union target of net greenhouse gas removals of 310 million tonnes of CO</span><span>2</span><span> equivalent will be distributed between Member States as annual national targets for the period from 2026 to 2030, and be based on the emissions and removals reported in the greenhouse gas inventories and the areas of managed land. A new system of governance of the target compliance will be introduced and the land use flexibility mechanism addressing risk of non-compliance by Member States will be adjusted. From 2031 onwards, the scope of the Regulation will be expanded to include non-CO</span><span>2</span><span> emissions from the agriculture sector, thus covering the whole land sector framework for the first time with one climate policy instrument.</span>

               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>The Impact Assessment identified three main problems, with corresponding drivers and objectives. </span>
               </p>
               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>The first problem is that carbon removals in the land sector have been decreasing in recent years: due to increasing harvesting rates related to wood demand and forest aging, continued emissions from organic soils, natural disasters and a lack of policy and financial incentives. Thus, the first objective of this proposal is to stop and reverse this trend, in line with an ambition to achieve a climate-neutral land sector in 2035. </span>
               </p>
               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>The second problem is the insufficient integration of the land sector into climate policies, due to the fact that the Agriculture and LULUCF sectors have no integrated target, are covered by two different pieces of legislation, and are linked by flexibility rules which presented some limitations. The corresponding objective is to ensure a fair, flexible and integrated climate policy framework to incentivise effective policymaking and implementation, and to enhance cost-efficient and synergistic mitigation action in the land sector. This is of particular importance given the high potential to increase the synergies between climate mitigation measures and environmental protection measures related to land management both in areas under agriculture and forestry as well as natural and semi-natural areas. The restoration of carbon rich ecosystems as well as the sustainable use of soils and forests will both contribute to addressing the climate and biodiversity crisis.</span>
               </p>
               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>The third problem is that the accounting, monitoring and reporting rules as set out in the current LULUCF Regulation present implementation challenges: in particular, the process to establish Forest Reference Levels has proven to be burdensome and there are still many gaps in the accuracy of LULUCF estimates. This problem corresponds to an objective to simplify the accounting rules and to exploit the opportunities created by existing land monitoring technologies and datasets to better monitor the climate performance of the LULUCF sector.</span>
               </p>
               <p class="Normal">
                  <span><span class="tab">   </span></span><span>Policy options</span>
               </p>
               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>Following this analysis and the elements outlined in the Communication on Stepping up Europe’s 2030 climate ambition, the Impact Assessment described three options. </span>
               </p>
               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>The first option looks at alternative ways to design national LULUCF targets, assuming that no flexibility channel exists between the LULUCF sector and the ESR sectors. One proposed way of doing this is to simplify the accounting benchmark for managed forest land by using a historic average instead of the Forest Reference Level. Another way is to set a single removal target based on all emissions and removals reported in the inventory and to distribute it among Member States according to the recent emissions and removals and the area of managed land; the EU target is set in line with a trajectory towards a climate-neutral land sector in 2035. </span>
               </p>
               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>The second option also sets a single removal target based on reported emissions and removals, but it proposes a lower EU target for 2030 corresponding to the recent performance of the LULUCF sector (i.e. the 2016-2018 average); by adding the possibility to generate LULUCF credits for compliance with ESR targets, this option creates incentives to overachieve the LULUCF targets, potentially reaching a level of removals in line with a trajectory towards a climate-neutral land sector in 2035. </span>
               </p>
               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>The third option combines emissions from the Agriculture sector and emissions and removals from the LULUCF sector under a single “land sector” pillar, and features three elements: a planning process to ensure land-based climate neutrality in 2035, national binding targets for the land sector in 2030, and national binding targets for the land sector in 2035.</span>
               </p>
               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>The preferred option is to combine simplified and more ambitious LULUCF national targets in 2030 (as in Option 1.2 or Option 2, depending on the ESR targets) with an EU-wide objective of land-based climate-neutrality in 2035. The preferred option also features a planning process for land-based mitigation, national land targets for 2035 to be established at a later stage, and upgraded monitoring and reporting requirements.</span>

The initiative builds on the process based on integrated national energy and climate plans and the robust transparency framework for greenhouse gas emissions and other climate information that is contained in Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action. The Commission will use inter alia the information reported by Member States under the Governance Regulation as a basis for its regular assessment of progress.

                  <span>Enhanced quality of monitoring and reporting of emissions and removals in the land use, land use change and the forestry sector becomes more prominent with the introduction of the EU net emissions reduction target based on the numbers reported in the greenhouse gas inventories. Coherence with other EU policies that also rely on land monitoring – such as the Common Agricultural Policy, biodiversity policies, and the Renewable Energy Directive – is also of strong significance, providing important administrative and cost synergies. Thanks to evolutions in land monitoring technologies, there are abundant opportunities to monitor land use changes at low cost and in a timely fashion (e.g. by using approaches based on remote sensing, including from the Copernicus Sentinel satellites or commercially available services).  Such timely, EU coverage digital geo-data will not only facilitate GHG reporting but also guide mitigation action to areas with the highest potential for emission reductions, and more generally enable environmental action, biodiversity, nature protection and land use planning. Upgrading the monitoring approach in the LULUCF Regulation, thereby introducing a level playing field for all Member States with respect to using comparable and standardized approaches in line with available tools and technologies, is therefore of major importance and will ensure adoption of best practices for monitoring.</span>

               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>In the original Article 4, the term “commitments” was used to express the obligation without a specific numerical target. The new Article 4 “Commitments and targets” will be revised to reflect the three periods:</span>

                  <span>Under the current rules, the Member States are committed to ensure that the greenhouse gas emissions do not exceed removals, calculated as the sum of total emissions and total removals in the accounting categories as defined in the scope (Article 2(1)); the “no-debit rule”.

               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>For the period from 2026 to 2030, the Union target will be set out to reach net removals of 310 million tonnes CO</span><span>2</span><span> equivalent by 2030, based on the greenhouse gas inventory from the years 2016, 2017 and 2018. The Union target of 310 million tonnes CO</span><span>2</span><span> equivalent of net removals will be distributed among the Member States in order to determine binding national targets of minimum net removals to achieve in 2030 according to a table in Annex IIa. </span>
               </p>
               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>Two considerations make the use of recent data preferable. First, the start point for the trajectory should be as close to the compliance period as possible – this has a technical impact that eliminates the need for setting a benchmark like the Forest Reference Level. Second, the LULUCF inventories starting with the 2023 submission will be the first to be under conditions of the Governance Regulation, and thus of a higher standard. In 2025, based on the results of a comprehensive review of the reported greenhouse gas inventory, the Commission will adopt an implementing act determining the annual targets based on the verified emissions and removals from years 2021, 2022 and 2023 for each Member State. The most recent reviewed data will therefore serve as a basis for setting the annual targets trajectory for 2026-2029 towards achieving the national net removal targets for 2030.</span>

                  <span>From 2031 onwards, the LULUCF sector will include the non-CO</span><span>2</span><span> emissions from agriculture sector and the amended Regulation will aim towards the  objective to achieve climate neutrality in the Union-wide greenhouse gas emissions and removals in the combined sectors at the latest by 2035; reducing emissions to net zero by that date and generating negative emissions thereafter. The Member States are obliged to contribute to reach the collective target and need to present how they intend to achieve this objective in their updated integrated national energy and climate plans by June 2024. In view of the submitted plans, the Commission will propose, by the end of 2025, individual Member State targets and EU-wide measures for post-2030 period. The post-2030 individual targets for the Member States will be the subject to an impact assessment and a new legislative proposal. </span>

                  <span>From 2036 onwards, the combined sector will need to generate further carbon removals to balance remaining emissions in other sectors, based on a robust carbon removal certification system. This policy framework could start to progressively combine the land sector with other sectors (beyond agriculture) that have exhausted their emissions reduction possibilities, or that have achieved for instance over 90% emission reductions. Thus, an incentive to steadily increase carbon removals in the combined sectors for period up to 2050 would be preserved.</span>

                  <span>Under the amended Regulation, the Member States will not be able any more to ‘bank’ surplus removals at the end of the period 2021-2025. However, the amendment ensures the allocation of a share of Member States’ surplus removals at the end of the period 2021-2025 to an established flexibility mechanism under the second period from 2026 to 2030 (see the newly inserted Article 13b).</span>

                  <span>The scope of present Article 13 will be limited to the 2021 to 2025 accounting period, with the total available flexibility amounting to a share of the flexibility surplus, which was unused  by the Member States during the period from 2021 to 2025 under Article 13. </span>
               </p>
               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>A surplus after the first period is expected, given that currently forest net removals in major Member States are significantly larger than the adopted Forest Reference Levels. Consequently, nearly all forest rich Member States will likely meet their commitments for the period from 2021 to 2025 under the LULUCF Regulation without the need to use their flexibility. It is therefore probable that this would leave a significant share of the available flexibility unused, which can supply the newly established mechanism for the redistribution of any unused Managed Forest Land compensation for Member States hit by natural disturbances.</span>

               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>Since the change towards the reporting-based national target makes the current Articles 10 (Natural disturbances) and 13 (Managed forest land flexibility) redundant from 2025, a new flexibility mechanism is introduced in the amended Regulation for the period from 2026 to 2030 to help Member States deal with the uncertainties of the sector, in particular from natural disasters. It will operate under similar principles to the current Article 13, extending the scope from forest land to all the land relevant for the target compliance. The mechanism would then deal with any unexpected decrease in net removals on all land categories, not only forest, due to pest, fire, and storms, on condition of clear evidence to be submitted by the Member States in accordance with existing criteria (Annex VI) . </span>

In the case where a Member State fails to comply with its 2030 target at the end of the second compliance period, despite the transfer option from another MS and the relevant share of the flexibility mechanism, the gap between its 2030 target and the net emissions reduction really achieved in 2030 will be added to its target determined for 2031.</span>

A collective commitment aiming to achieve climate-neutrality in the land sector in 2035 at EU level can provide the needed planning certainty to drive land-based mitigation action in the short term, considering that it can take many years for such action to deliver the desired mitigation outcomes. Moreover, the land sector is projected to become the largest sector in the EU greenhouse gas flux profile in 2050. It is therefore particularly important to anchor that sector to a trajectory that can effectively deliver net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. By mid-2024, the Member States should submit their updated integrated national energy and climate plans in accordance with Article 14 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council</span><span class="FootnoteReference">

The plans should include relevant measures by which each Member State best contributes to the collective target of climate neutrality in the land sector at EU level in 2035. On the basis of these plans, the Commission should propose national targets, ensuring that the Union-wide greenhouse gas emissions and removals in the land use, land use change and forestry sector and the emissions from the agriculture non-CO2 sectors are at least balanced by 2035. Contrary to the EU level target of climate neutrality for the land sector by 2035, such national targets will be binding and enforceable on each Member State.</span>

                  <span>Besides its capacity to store and sequester carbon, land provides many other important products and services: supplies the bioeconomy sectors with food, feed and feedstocks, provides habitats to biodiversity and many ecosystem services vital for life (e.g. water and air purification), and protects us from some of the consequences of climate change (e.g. floods and desertification). The interdependence between these functions and the capacity of the LULUCF sector to sequester carbon from the atmosphere calls for an integrated approach to climate action in the land sector, in order to optimise land use planning and identify win-win practices.</span>

                  <span>The potential to increase land-based carbon removals and the associated costs are, moreover, unevenly distributed across Member States.

With the revised LULUCF regulation implementing higher Tier methodologies for the MS, and in particular to better distinguish different types of land areas into high carbon stock lands, areas under protection and areas under climate change risk, additional geospatial datasets need to be derived to support Member States.

                  <span>The revised LULUCF regulation sets ambitious and credible targets for the LULUCF and agricultural sector to support the achievement of a net greenhouse gas emission reduction of at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990, as set out in the European Climate Law. The revised LULUCF regulation proposal aims to increase carbon sequestration in the agriculture and LULUCF sectors, with the goal of carbon neutrality of the combined two sectors by 2035. At the same, it should ensure that this increased CO</span><span>2</span><span> removal does not lead to negative impacts on the environment, in particular biodiversity, on public health or on social or economic objectives.</span>

               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>The revised LULUCF regulation will therefore require Member States to use more precise methodologies to estimate emissions and removals from their agriculture and LULUCF sectors, including by making more use of geospatial data to support these higher Tier level calculations. In particular, to be able to identify and track carbon pools within high carbon stock lands, areas under protection and areas under climate change risk, high level  methodologies requiring timely, standardised and EU harmonised datasets and services will be needed, applied in accordance with the IPCC guidelines. </span>

               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>As a consequence of this change from a “no-debit rule” regulation towards a net emissions contribution of the LULUCF sector to the overall EU climate target, which will come into operation from the 2026 year, compliance targets will need to be set requiring additional comprehensive GHG inventory reviews. This will require a preparatory phase during 2024/25.</span>

                  <span>Besides its capacity to store and sequester carbon, land provides many other important products and services: supplies the bioeconomy sectors with food, feed and feedstocks, provides habitats to biodiversity and many ecosystem services vital for life (e.g. water and air purification), and protects us from some of the consequences of climate change (e.g. floods and desertification). The interdependence between these functions and the capacity of the LULUCF sector to sequester carbon from the atmosphere calls for an integrated approach to climate action in the land sector, in order to optimise land use planning and identify win-win practices.</span>
