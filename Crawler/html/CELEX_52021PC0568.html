On 25 May 2021, the European Council reaffirmed these conclusions and invited the Commissio</span><span>n to swiftly put forward its legislative package together with an in-depth examination of the environmental, economic and social impact at Member State level. Both, the climate neutrality of the Union by 2050 and the intermediate net emission reduction of </span><span>at least 55% by 2030 are enshrined in Regulation (EU) </span><span>2021/1119</span><span> of the European Parliament and of the Council</span><span class="FootnoteReference">

            <p class="Normal">
               <span>In order to implement the European Climate Law and the conclusions of the European Council, the Commission has reviewed the climate and energy legislation currently in place and proposes the ‘</span><span>Fit for 55</span><span>’ legislative package.</span>

            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The increased Union climate ambition also means the contribution from all sectors need to be increased. For that purpose, emissions trading for </span><span>buildings and road transport is proposed as part of the revision of Directive 2003/87/EC</span><span class="FootnoteReference">

Introducing a market price on carbon in these two sectors in conjunction with other measures should in the medium to long term reduce the costs for buildings and road transport, and will provide new opportunities for investment and job cr</span><span>eation that will be taken full advantage of in the presence of the a</span><span>ppropriate labour market and skill policies like those supported at the EU level by the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+) established by Regulation (EU) 2021/1057 of the European Parliament</span><span> and of the Council</span><span class="FootnoteReference">

            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>However, the increase in the price for fossil fuels will have significant social and distributional impacts that may disproportionally affect vulnerable households, vulnerable micro-enterprises and vulnerable transport users who spend a larger part of their incomes on energy and transport and who, in certain regions, do not have access to alternative, affordable mobility and transport solutions. Such impacts on vulnerable groups differ between Member States, and price impacts are likely to be felt more strongly in Member States, regions and population with lower average income. As corollary to the fuel price increases through carbon pricing, the emissions trading generates revenues, which can be used to alleviate the burden on the vulnerable groups.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>To address the social </span><span>and distributional </span><span>impacts </span><span>on the most vulnerable </span><span>arising from the emissions trading for the t</span><span>wo new sectors of buildings and road transport, a Social Climate Fund (‘the Fund’) is created. The adjustments to the Union budgetary framework necessary for this proposal will be presented by the Commission as part of the upcoming </span><span>Own Resources package in</span><span>cluding a proposal to amend the multiannual financial framework</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref10" href="#footnote10">9</a>
               </span><span>. In particular, part of the revenues from the emission trading for buildings and road transport will accrue to the Union budget and a percentage of it will in principle correspond to the new </span><span>Fund</span><span>. Before the end of the year, the Commission also intends to present a proposal for a Council Recommendation on how to address the social aspects of the desired green transition.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The Fund aims at mitigating the price impact of the new carbon pricing and should provide funding to Member States to support their policies to address the social impacts of such emissions trading on vulnerable households, vulnerable micro-enterprises and vulnerable transport users. This should be achieved notably through temporary income support and measures and investments intended to reduce in the medium to long term the reliance on fossil fuels through increased energy efficiency of buildings, decarbonisation of heating and cooling of buildings, including the integration of energy from renewable sources, and granting improved access to zero- and low-emission mobility and transport.</span>

            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The European Green Deal acknowledged that the need for a socially just transition must also be reflected in policies at Union and national level. This includes investments to provide affordable solutions to those worst affected by, and less able to cope with, carbon pricing policies, for example through improved public transport, as well as measures to mitigate and address energy poverty and promote re-skilling. This is in line with Principles 1 and Principle 20 of the European Pillar of Social Rights to facilitate labour market transitions in the context of the twin transitions and the recovery from the socio-economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and ensure access to essential services such as energy and mobility for all.</span>

The creation of a Union programme also ensures that all Member States can take measures to complement the climate action at Union level.

A new fund in direct management in the Union budget complements these measures in a way that provides specifically for, and is directly linked to the social challenges from emission trading in the sectors of buildings and road transport through a results oriented integrated approach based on an agreed plan with clear targets, milestones and deliverables.

Among the presented options, the preferred policy option of a wide range of stakeholders was to start with a separate self-standing system for the building and road transport sectors, as reflected in the proposal on the ETS revision. Several stakeholders also referred to the social impacts of an increase in the price for heating and transport fuels on the most vulnerable households. In particular, it was highlighted that low-income households may need support in order to carry out the necessary investments in energy efficiency and zero- and low-emission mobility and transport.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The problems addressed by the proposed Fund and the possible solution directions are analysed in two consecutive impact assessments, therefore no specific impact assessment was carried out.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The impact assessment underpinning the 2030 Climate Target Plan found that an increase of the 2030 emission target to -55% increases the share of energy related households expenditures by around 0.7 to 0.8 percentage points. Changes in consumer prices affect households in contrasted manners that depend on their expenditure structure, level and sources of incomes, wealth and the very composition of the household.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The estimated changes in relative prices generated by higher climate ambition would affect lower income earners significantly more than the top income earners. However, these results do not include the redistribution of auction revenues. If for example, a lump-sum redistribution of the auction revenues based on household size is introduced for each Member State, this could generate a positive welfare impact on the bottom expenditure decile of the Union population as a whole and sharply reduce the negative impact on all other expenditure classes. The impact assessment also concluded that as an actual policy, a redistribution mechanism could be significantly more targeted to address the needs of lower income/expenditure deciles. This would enable a higher degree of compensation for and support to the households in need for any given level of revenue generated by carbon pricing.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The impact assessment accompanying the Proposal for amending the ETS Directive within the ‘</span><span>Fit for 55’ package </span><span>refines this analysis. It puts a specific focus on introducing emissions trading for buildings and road transport and analyses its social impacts, in particular on the lower-income and vulnerable households. Notably it disaggregates the household energy expenditure into fuel costs and capital costs for investments, as well as per main household income groups and Member State income groups.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Residential investment expenditures are expected to increase in 2030 in the Union by 0.4 to 0.7 percentage points of household income compared to the baseline as consequence of the </span><span>‘Fit for 55’</span><span> package. In a more carbon price driven policy setting, investment expenditures increase less strongly than in a more balanced policy mix. In a cost-effective policy mix the investment expenditure increases for lower income households would be across all MS income groups over double of the average household. Increases are well above Union average in MS with a GDP per capita below 60% of the Union average. This shows the importance of access to finance, for renovation of the housing stock, and the purchase of energy efficient equipment, in particular in lower income Member States.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The impact assessment for the revision of the ETS Directive found that emissions trading for buildings will not affect households equally, but would likely have a regressive impact on disposable income, as low-income households tend to spend a greater proportion of their income on heating. In addition, the introduction of a harmonised carbon price will have a very different impact on consumer prices in the Member States depending on the existing level of taxes on the fuels concerned, as pre-tax prices of fossil fuels are comparable across the Member States. However, overall fuel expenditures as percentage of income remain on average nearly stable. This means that there can be fuel expenditure savings despite the price increases, provided that cost-effective investments are realised. If these investments are realised, then on average the lower income households will be in a better position than the average household. For the low-income Member State group the share of fuel expenditures in household consumption expenditures rises across all income groups, and more strongly for low-income households. If the necessary energy efficiency, refurbishment and renewable energy investments are undertaken, the challenge of fuel price increases remains limited and focused on lower-income households in low-income Member States.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>With regards to road transport, the Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy (‘SSMS’) and the impact assessment, accompanying the 2030 Climate Target Plan, have recognised the central importance of investments aimed at boosting demand for zero- and low-emission vehicles and at accelerating the rollout of recharging and refuelling infrastructure for these vehicles, which will play a key role in achieving the goal of decarbonising significantly road transport by 2030.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The impact assessment accompanying the proposal to revise the ETS Directive finds that the impacts on the households from the emissions trading for road transport are mixed. Typically, it is the lower-middle and middle parts of the household income classes where the proportion of spending on transport is highest (because the lowest income households do not have access to a private vehicle).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>However, the impact assessment also concludes that although the carbon pricing increases energy costs for consumers, at the same time it raises revenues, which can be used for reinvestments, for stimulating climate action and to address social or distributional impacts of carbon pricing. Revenues from the auctioning of allowances under that emissions trading can be used through different redistributive mechanisms as compensation to the consumers, support to investment in energy efficiency or in renewables, or other options.</span>

Increasing the 2030 target for EU greenhouse gas reductions will impact many sectors across the EU economy and coordinated action as well as financial support at the EU level is therefore indispensable. In line with Article 191(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (“TFEU”), the Union policy on the environment shall contribute to preserving, protecting and improving the quality of the environment; as well as promoting measures at international level to deal with regional or worldwide environmental problems, and in particular combating climate change.

In order to receive funding, the Member Stes are to establish Social Plans that will list the activities (measures and investments) they intend to finance from the Fund. Funding from the Union budget concentrates on activities whose objectives cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States alone ("necessity test"), and where the Union intervention can bring additional value compared to action of Member States alone. Action at the Union level is needed to coordinate an appropriate response to the social challenges from emissions trading for the sectors of buildings and road transport (“effectiveness test”). This goal cannot be achieved to a sufficient degree by the Member States acting alone, while the Union's intervention can bring additional value by establishing an instrument targeted at supporting Member States financially as regards the design and implementation of necessary measures and investments.</span>

                  <span>In order to receive funds from the Fund, Member States should develop their Social Climate Plans (‘Plans’) to set the measures and investments to be financed.  The Commission is to assess those Plans and may approve them only after a positive assessment based on their relevance, effectiveness, efficiency and coherence. The disbursement of the financial allocation will follow the completion of the milestones and targets agreed with the Member State concerned. The submission timing of the Plans, as well as progress reporting cycles are aligned with the updates of the integrated national energy and climate plans submitted under Regulation (EU)2018/1999.</span>
               </p>
               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>For that purpose, twice per year Member States may request a payment under the Fund that should be accompanied by evidence on the progress made towards milestones and targets. The Member States should report to the Commission on the progress made for the implementation of the measures and investments under their plans in the biennial reporting on progress in the implementation of their national energy and claimed plans (NECPs) under the Governance Regulation.</span>

               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>An evaluation and an ex-post evaluation will be carried out with a view to assessing the effectiveness, efficiency, relevance and coherence of the Fund. Where appropriate, the Commission will accompany the evaluation with a proposal for review of the Regulation.</span>

                  <span>Financing the actions included in the Plans submitted by the Member States, with national contributions, is the most appropriate solution.
