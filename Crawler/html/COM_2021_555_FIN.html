               <span>Tackling climate change is an urgent challenge. In line with the scientific findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report, global net-zero CO</span><span>2</span><span> emissions need to be achieved around 2050, and neutrality for all other greenhouse gases later in the century. This urgent challenge requires the EU to step up its action and demonstrate global leadership by becoming climate neutral by 2050. This objective is set out in the Communication ‘</span><span>A Clean Planet for all’ </span><span>- A European strategic long-term vision for a prosperous, modern, competitive and climate-neutral economy’</span><span class="FootnoteReference">

               </span><span> (2030 Climate Target Plan) proposed to raise the EU's ambition and put forward a comprehensive plan to increase the European Union’s binding target for 2030 towards at least 55% net emission reductions compared to 1990, in a responsible way. Raising the 2030 ambition now helps give certainty to policymakers and investors, so that decisions made in the coming years do not lock in emission levels inconsistent with the EU’s objective to be climate neutral by 2050. The 2030 target is in line with the Paris Agreement objective to keep the global temperature increase to well below 2°C and pursue efforts to keep it to 1.5°C. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The European Council endorsed the new EU binding target for 2030 at its meeting of December 2020</span><span class="FootnoteReference">

               </span><span>. It also called on the Commission “</span><span>to assess how all economic sectors can best contribute to the 2030 target and to make the necessary proposals, accompanied by an in-depth examination of the environmental, economic and social impact at Member State level, taking into account national energy and climate plans and reviewing existing flexibilities</span><span>”.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>To this end, the Regulation establishing the framework for achieving climate neutrality (‘</span><span>European Climate Law</span><span>’)</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref6" href="#footnote6">5</a>
               </span><span> made the EU’s climate neutrality target by 2050 legally binding, and raised the 2030 ambition, which </span><span>shall be a </span><span>domestic</span><span> </span><span>reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions (emissions after deduction of removals) by at least 55% compared to 1990 levels by 2030</span><span>.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>In order to follow the pathway set in the European Climate Law and deliver this increased level of ambition for 2030, the Commission has reviewed the climate and energy legislation currently in place, which would likely only reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2030 and by 60% by 2050.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>This ‘Fit for 55’ legislative package, as announced in the Commission’s Climate Target Plan, is the most comprehensive building block in the efforts to implement the ambitious new 2030 climate target, and all economic sectors and policies will need to make their contribution.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>As a part of the ‘Fit for 55’ package, this proposal aims to amend the Effort Sharing Regulation</span><span class="FootnoteReference">

               </span><span> (‘ESR’) in order to align its contribution towards delivering the increased ambition for 2030. In December 2020, the European Council called for delivering the target collectively by the EU in the most cost-effective manner possible, preserving EU’s competitiveness and taking account of Member States’ different starting points, specific national circumstances and emission reduction potential. It gave further guidance on key elements for a revised 2030 climate and energy policy framework. To achieve at least 55% greenhouse gas emission reductions economy wide, the sectors under the Effort Sharing Regulation will need to step up efforts. The impact assessment supporting the Climate Target Plan indicated that overall reductions would need to increase by around 10 percentage points from the current ESR target of -30% compared to 2005. The need to review the ESR, decide on its scope and increase ambition were already elaborated in the Climate Target Plan.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The ESR currently covers all </span><span>greenhouse gas</span><span> emissions included in the EU’s target which are covered neither by the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) nor by the Regulation on Land-Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF). It currently covers direct </span><span>greenhouse gas</span><span> emissions from transport (except aviation and non-domestic shipping), buildings, agriculture, industrial installations and gases not covered by the EU ETS and waste as well as non-combustion related emissions from energy and product use. It includes both CO</span><span>2</span><span> emissions as well as a significant share of non-CO</span><span>2</span><span> emissions. </span><span>The ESR legislation was adopted in 2018 to deliver a 30%</span><span class="FootnoteReference">

               </span><span> reduction in emissions covered by 2030 compared to 2005, coherent with an EU economy-wide emission reduction target of at least 40% by 2030 compared to 1990. The ESR establishes binding annual greenhouse gas emission targets for Member States which collectively deliver this reduction. I</span><span>f the legislation remains unchanged, sectors currently covered by the ESR would together achieve a 2030 emission reduction of -32% compared to 2005</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref9" href="#footnote9">8</a>
               </span><span>. Even though this would mean outperforming the contribution of -30% referred to above, this would still be an insufficient contribution to an overall target of at least -55% compared to 1990, in line with the European Climate Law agreement. Therefore, the general objective of this initiative is to revise the ESR so that it contributes to the 2030 climate ambition to reach at least 55% net greenhouse gas emission reductions by 2030 below 1990 levels in a cost-effective and coherent way while taking into account the need for a just transition and the need for all sectors to contribute to the EU’s climate efforts. The aim is to achieve a gradual and balanced trajectory towards climate neutrality by 2050.</span>

               <span>This proposal upgrades national targets in line with an EU-wide reduction of 40% in the ESR sectors compared to 2005 by 2030. Member States contribute to the overall EU reduction in 2030 with targets ranging from -10% to -50% below 2005 levels.  </span>

Overall, the EU budget (MFF) 2021-2027 and the Next Generation EU package will ensure a 30% climate mainstreaming expenditure target. As regards specifically the Resilience and Recovery Facility under Next Generation EU, each national recovery and resilience plan will have to include a minimum of 37% of expenditure related to climate investments. Cohesion policy will contribute to climate expenditure with 100% of the Just Transition Fund, and at least 37% of the Cohesion Fund and 30% of the European Regional Development Fund.

Since 1992, the European Union has worked to develop joint solutions and drive forward global action to tackle climate change. More specifically, action at EU level will provide for cost effective delivery of the 2030 and long-term emission reduction objectives while ensuring fairness and environmental integrity. Articles 191 to 193 of the TFEU confirm and specify EU competencies in the area of climate change. </span>

The great majority of respondents agreed that the sectors covered by the ESR should deliver additional reductions and that Member States should step-up their efforts and pursue more ambitious targets. A majority of respondents were in favour of parallel coverage of ESR and ETS in case of an extension of the ETS, to buildings and road transport, with a large majority of NGOs and citizens’ in favour of this option. A smaller but significant share of respondents were in favour of reducing the sectoral scope of the ESR with a much more limited majority of private sector replies in favour of this option (especially coming from the energy sector).

               class="Normal">
               <span>Within options 1 and 2, the impact assessment also addresses the appropriate level of increase of the targets on emission reductions, namely whether the increase should be strong or moderate, the distribution of efforts among Member States and their contribution to the collective target, the starting point of the annual allocations trajectories, and the functioning of the ETS and LULUCF flexibilities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>So far, the EU ETS Directive, the ESR and the LULUCF Regulation together have covered the greenhouse emissions of different parts of the economy, each of them defining the contribution of the covered sectors to the overall target. Specific questions arise from the extension of carbon pricing, an important tool to combat greenhouse gas emissions, to new sectors. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The creation of a new emission trading for road transport and buildings warranted the consideration of the scope of the Effort Sharing Regulation itself, taking into account the effectiveness, cost-efficiency and fairness of the instrument and the climate policy architecture as a whole. Similarly, a change in the scope of the LULUCF Regulation towards a Land Use instrument could also impact the ESR scope. However, the LULUCF proposal only foresees national targets for the land sector after 2030, and therefore, does not impact the ESR proposal, which has a time scope limited to 2030. Additionally, different options for the scope of the ESR have been considered and assessed in the impact assessment, notably whether or not a sector is included both in the ESR and in emission trading, and/or a land use instrument would impact the achievement of the overall EU target by 2030. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The application of emissions trading to sectors such as buildings and road transport will cover around half of the emissions of today’s Effort Sharing Regulation. As with the current ETS, such a system will integrate the price of CO2 in economic and financial decisions and will be an important tool to incentivise cost effective action by business and consumers in these sectors across all Member States. At the same time, a carbon price on its own would not deliver the required transformation in the sectors concerned in an efficient manner. The 2030 Climate Target Plan concluded that there is a clear need for complementary and targeted policies. These can address market failures and split incentives, accelerate technological change and develop the required infrastructure in a coordinated way (e.g. for building renovation, electrification and hydrogen technology for industry). </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Therefore, it would be premature to leave the aimed decrease in emissions from buildings and road transport exclusively to emission trading. Such an option will deserve proper consideration in a future review of the ESR, building on the lessons learned from the functioning of emission trading for these two sectors. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The preferred option is to increase ambition in the ESR, in line with the cost efficient projections, to achieve the overall climate ambition for 2030 set out in the 2030 Climate Target Plan. The extension of emission trading to new sectors – road transport and building- while keeping them under the ESR scope, is seen as contributing to the achievement of the ESR target, and not as a substitution of it.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Increasing the national targets under the ESR requires revisiting fairness and cost efficiency within the instrument. As regards fairness, the assessment concludes that an update of the target setting approach based on GDP per capita is still appropriate, while applying a limited amount of targeted corrections to address cost efficiency concerns. Overall this will drive towards convergence of per capita emissions in these sectors across the EU.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>In view of ensuring maximum cost-efficiency, all existing flexibilities are expected to be used with the increased ambition, reflected in a 40% EU target for ESR. The flexibility instruments, both in their scale and functioning, are deemed to be appropriate to ensure enhanced cost efficiency of the overall policy. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>New binding national limits, expressed in annual emission allocations, progressively leading to the 2030 target of each Member State will need to be established for the years 2023 to 2030. The emission allocations for the years 2023, 2024 and 2025 will be calculated on the basis of the greenhouse gas emissions data for the years 2005 and 2016 to 2018 as reviewed by the Commission in accordance with Article 4(3) of the ESR. For greater accuracy, the calculation of the annual emission allocations for the years 2026 to 2030 will be based on the average of the greenhouse gas emissions of each Member State during the years 2021, 2022 and 2023 following a comprehensive review of the national inventory data to be carried out by the Commission in 2025. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Body">
               <span>Furthermore, the Commission is to carry out, in 2027, a comprehensive review of the national inventory data for the purpose of compliance with the ESR, as provided for in Article 38 of the Governance Regulation. The Commission will determine by means of implementing acts, the scope of those two comprehensive reviews in order to avoid unnecessary duplication of tasks.</span>

               <span>Transparent and regular reporting on Member State obligations coupled with robust compliance checks are fundamental elements ensuring progress in delivering the EU long-term emission reduction commitments. The initiative maintains the compliance regime of the ESR and continues to rely on the robust monitoring, reporting and verification framework provided in the Governance Regulation. The Commission will use inter alia the information submitted and reported by Member States under the Governance Regulation as a basis for its regular assessment of progress. This includes information on greenhouse gas emissions, policies and measures, projections and adaptation. The Commission will also make use of this information for the Environmental Implementation Reviews and the monitoring of the Environment Action Programmes. Information obtained from Member States may be complemented by systematic atmospheric observations through in situ as well as remote sensing observations, such as those provided by Copernicus. </span>

               <span>The effectiveness of the proposal in achieving the revised 2030 targets depends of the capacity of Member States to adjust their plans and strategies to a more vigorous response to the challenge of climate change. In this context the Commission will put in place capacity building measures to support Member States in their efforts to incorporate the revised targets into their national climate plans and strategies, including the National Energy and Climate Plans.</span>
