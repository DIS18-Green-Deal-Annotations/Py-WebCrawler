            <div class="border">
               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>In March 2020, the Commission tabled a proposal for a European Climate Law to decarbonise Europe by 2050. In its Climate Target Plan (CTP)</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                     <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref4" href="#footnote4">3</a>
                  </span><span>, the Commission proposed to raise the Union's ambition on reducing greenhouse gas emissions to at least 55% below 1990 levels by 2030, which is a substantial increase compared to the existing 40% target. The Climate Target Plan also outlined necessary </span><span>actions required across all sectors of the economy, including the revisions of the key legislative instruments to achieve this increased ambition </span><span>and to deliver on the commitment made in the Communication on the European Green Deal</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                     <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref5" href="#footnote5">4</a>
                  </span><span> to put forward a comprehensive plan to increase the European Union’s target for 2030 towards 55% in a responsible way. The Climate Target Plan is also in line with the Paris Agreement' objective to keep the global temperature increase to well below 2°C and pursue efforts to keep it to 1,5°C. In December 2020, the European Council endorsed a binding EU target of a net domestic reduction of at least 55% in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990.</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                     <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref6" href="#footnote6">5</a>
                  </span><span> The European Council concluded that climate ambition needed to be raised in a manner that would spur sustainable economic growth, create quality jobs, deliver health and environmental benefits for citizens of the Union, and contribute to the long-term global competitiveness of the Union’s economy by promoting innovation in green technologies.</span><span> On 22 April 2021, the European Parliament and the Council came to a provisional political agreement to achieve at least a 55% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030. This sets the framework for action to reduce GHG emissions over the coming decades, but needs to be implemented through specific legislation to ensure those reductions occur. </span><span>Projections indicate that, if current policies are fully implemented, greenhouse gas emissions reductions </span><span>by 2030 would be around 45% compared to 1990 levels, when excluding land use emissions and absorptions, and around 47%, when including land use. The 2030 Climate Target Plan therefore previews a set of actions required across all sectors of the economy and the launch of revisions of the key legislative instruments to achieve this increased ambition.</span>
               </p>
               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>To implement this, the European Commission 2021 Work Programme</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                     <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref7" href="#footnote7">6</a>
                  </span><span> announced a ‘Fit for 55’ package to reduce GHG emissions by at least 55% by 2030, and achieve a climate-neutral Europe by 2050. This package will cover a wide range of policy areas including energy efficiency, renewables, land use, energy taxation, effort sharing and emissions trading.</span>
               </p>
               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>Energy efficiency is a key area of action, without which the full decarbonisation of the Union economy cannot be achieved</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                     <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref8" href="#footnote8">7</a>
                  </span><span>. The Energy Efficiency Directive has led to the Union’s current energy efficiency policy to capture the cost-effective energy saving opportunities. In December 2018, the Energy Efficiency Directive was amended as part of the 'Clean Energy for All Europeans package’, in particular to include a new headline 2030 Union energy efficiency target of at least 32,5% (compared to projected energy use in 2030), and to extend and strengthen the energy savings obligation beyond 2020.</span>
               </p>
               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>While the 2020 energy efficiency target may have been achieved due to the exceptional circumstances</span><span> </span><span>created by the Covid-19 pandemic, the sum of national contributions communicated by Member States in the National Energy Climate Plans (NECP) falls short of the Union’s level of ambition of 32,5% in 2030. The contributions collectively would lead to a reduction of 29,4% for final energy consumption (FEC) and 29,7% for primary energy consumption (PEC) compared to the projections from the 2007 reference scenario for 2030. This would translate in a collective ambition gap of 2,8 percentage points for primary energy consumption and 3.1 percentage points for final energy consumption for EU27. This gap also affects the level of efforts needed to reach the higher ambition of energy efficiency targets. The CTP Impact Assessment concludes that it is unlikely that the necessary higher levels of energy efficiency needed would be achieved through market forces, current market organisation and technology development alone, meaning that further efforts are needed. According to the impact assessment</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                     <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref9" href="#footnote9">8</a>
                  </span><span> accompanying this Directive, energy efficiency improvements will need to be significantly stepped from the current ambition level of 32,5%.</span>
               </p>
               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>The higher ambition level requires a stronger promotion of energy efficiency, wherever cost-effective, in all areas of the energy system and in all relevant sectors, where activity affects energy demand, such as the transport, water and agriculture sectors. Addressing the water-energy nexus is particularly important, due to increasing water and energy needs, or increasing pressure on water resources due to climate change. </span>
               </p>
               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>The Energy Efficiency Directive is an important element to progress towards climate neutrality by 2050, under which energy efficiency is to be treated as an energy source in its own right. The key role of energy efficiency is supported by the energy efficiency first principle. It is recognised as a guiding principle of the Union energy policy and should be taken into account across all sectors, going beyond the energy system, at all levels, including in the financial sector. Energy efficiency solutions should be considered as the first option in planning and investment decisions, when setting new rules for the supply side and other policy areas. The principle has been recognised as a key element of the Strategy for Energy Sector Integration</span><span class="FootnoteReference">

               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>While the energy savings potential remains large in all sectors, there is a particular challenge related to transport, as it is responsible for 30% of final energy consumption, and to buildings, since 75% of the Union building stock has a poor energy performance. Another important sector to which increasing attention is being paid is the information and communications technology (ICT) sector, which is responsible for 5-9% of the world's total electricity use and more than 2% of all emissions. </span><span>In 2018, the energy consumption of data centres in the Union was 76,8 TWh. This is expected to rise to 98,5 TWh by 2030 a 28% increase.</span><span> T</span><span>his increase in absolute terms can as well be seen in relative terms: within the EU, data centres accounted for 2,7% of electricity demand in 2018 and will reach 3,21% by 2030, if development continues on the current trajectory</span><span class="FootnoteReference">

               </p>
               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>The public sector is an important economic actor in its own right and is responsible for around 5 to 10% of the total Union final energy consumption.</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                     <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref13" href="#footnote13">12</a>
                  </span><span> Overall, the Union´s-share of public procurement contracts attributed to central government bodies is estimated to be approximately 16%. At Member States’ level this varies between 5% and 86%</span><span class="FootnoteReference">

                  </span><span>. Public buildings are estimated to use around 2% of the Union’s final energy consumption. Cost effective savings potentials still exist in the entire public sector both in the renovation and energy management of existing buildings as well as the future procurement of energy efficient buildings, products and services.</span>

            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Industry is one of the sectors that has achieved significant energy efficiency improvements over the last decade. Nevertheless, cost-effective savings potentials still exist</span><span class="FootnoteReference">

               </span><span>. Heating and cooling consumes half of Union FEC, making it the biggest energy end-use sector. There remains much potential for reducing energy use in this sector, while still achieving the temperatures needed</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref16" href="#footnote16">15</a>
               </span><span>. Heating and cooling, therefore, plays a crucial role in the Union’s ambition to transition into a clean and carbon-neutral economy by 2050. Much of the effort is needed in the field of better insulating buildings, but there is also potential in terms of more efficiently supplying the heat or cold needed</span><span class="FootnoteReference">

               </span><span>. The absence of common methodologies and reporting makes it difficult to compare networks or operators or benchmark performance. In fact, there is no uniform definition of energy losses within the Union, which results in sub-optimal data quality, which needs to be addressed.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The household sector makes up around a quarter of all final energy consumption in the Union. The behaviour of consumers and citizens has an important impact on this energy consumption and the EED contains several provisions that support the empowerment of citizens and consumers. The lack of strong consumer behaviour and consumer empowerment aspects in promoting energy efficiency, in particular at more local levels, results in insufficient incentives for consumers to realise energy efficiency improvements and to tackle high upfront costs and</span><span> </span><span>the split incentives problem.</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref19" href="#footnote19">18</a>

            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>While the Energy Efficiency Directive already provides incentives for Member States to address energy poverty, the Covid19 crisis has highlighted the urgency of addressing energy poverty, if the Union is to create a social Europe, </span><span>as agreed by the joint Porto Social Commitment</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref20" href="#footnote20">19</a>

Energy poverty levels across Member States will be in the spotlight as more Europeans may struggle to afford access to essential energy, particularly with rising energy costs and unemployment. Also medium-income households might be at increasing risk of facing energy poverty in the near future, as already today the majority of households affected by energy poverty are (lower) middle-income households. Energy efficiency has been identified as the most effective solution to alleviate energy poverty and to overcome some of the potential negative distributional impacts of pricing measures.</span><span class="FootnoteReference">

               </span><span> As required by the European Green Deal, the Energy Efficiency Directive together with the other initiatives under the `Fit for 55 Package´, most notably the Social Climate Fund, will addresses the twin-challenge and turn both, climate and social needs, into opportunities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>In this context, </span><span>the amendments will help reinforce the Energy Efficiency Directive to better address remaining market barriers and failures by considering broader objectives of the European Green Deal, which aims to leave no one behind and to deliver a sustainable economy.

                  <span>This proposal for the Energy Efficiency Directive Recast sets a framework for other energy efficiency policies by laying down the energy efficiency targets and setting the main cross-sectoral measures as well as more specific ones. It targets energy savings in the public sector including via obligations to renovate public buildings annually and taking into account energy efficiency in procurement of goods, services, works and buildings. Its particular aim at public buildings is complementary to the EPBD, which sets the standards and specific technical obligations related to buildings. The public sector serves the population at large, including the vulnerable customers and those in risk of energy poverty, thus ensuring that no one is left behind in line with the objectives of the European Green Deal. The special focus on public sector in the Energy Efficiency Directive is vital to undertake its exemplary role in promoting energy efficiency. The Commission has started the review of the EPBD with a view to come forward with a proposal towards the end of 2021. While at this point in time it is not possible to prejudge the outcome of that review, this proposal respects the specific role of the EPBD in setting cost-optimal energy performance requirements, while strengthening the EED provisions pertaining to the exemplary role of public bodies, notably regarding buildings (Article 5 and Article 6), and public procurement (Article 7), which provides the necessary horizontal framework for action.</span>

                  <span>The Energy Efficiency Directive sets the framework for heating and cooling planning in terms of identifying the energy efficiency and renewable energy potential by the Members States. It also provides for monitoring policies and measures to exploit this potential. These policies and measures directly support the achievement of the renewable target in the heating and cooling sector target set out in Article 24 of the Renewable Energy Directive. For example, a revised definition of efficient district heating and cooling (Article 2(43) of the Energy Efficiency Directive) would directly promote the deployment of renewable energy in district heating and cooling. Vice versa, these sub-targets would contribute to the achievement of the energy efficiency objectives of the Energy Efficiency Directive.</span>

               <span>Changes to the policy architecture of the Energy Efficiency Directive interact with existing and planned policies and measures, including pricing and non-pricing mechanisms and measures. The Energy Efficiency Directive, which addresses existing market barriers hampering energy efficiency, works hand-in-hand with the introduction of emissions trading for fuels used in buildings, which will shorten payback time of energy efficiency investments and strengthen the business case for energy efficiency measures across the Union. The Climate Target Plan demonstrated that a mix of regulatory intervention and carbon pricing is needed to deliver the most cost effective pathway towards achieving the 55% GHG reduction target. Striking a balance between carbon pricing and the regulatory policies is crucial to achieve the increased climate target in a cost-efficient manner, while mitigating any impacts of carbon costs being passed on in particular on vulnerable customers and final users. At the same time, emissions trading will generate additional revenues from the allowance auctions that can be redistributed among Member States and within Member States in order to support vulnerable and energy poor end-users in paying their bills and carrying out building renovation.</span>

               <span>Before all measures and targets proposed under the `Fit for 55’ Package will fully take effect and relieve European citizens from dependencies from fossil fuels and increasing energy costs, during the transition period some action can lead to significant distributional effects. The extension of the EU ETS to the buildings and transport sectors is expected to result in increasing energy prices as fuel suppliers are likely to pass on carbon costs to consumers, and may thus affect vulnerable customers and final users relying on fossil fuels, or people at risk of energy poverty. Targeted measures to ease the transition both at European and at national level. The `Fit for 55 Package´ proposes specific measures under the EED, and a new funding instrument based on the revenues from the new ETS to mitigate the impact of higher costs for consumers as a result of the introduction of a carbon price in the road transport and building sectors. It is key to ensure that energy efficiency investments take place amongst the most vulnerable in our societies. Support measures to strengthen the energy savings obligation and to empower and protect vulnerable customers, households affected by or at risk of energy poverty, and, where applicable, people living in social housing, can help to mitigate these effects. A combined effect of the proposed measures under the EED and the new funding tool based on the revenues from emissions trading in the new sectors will help addressing the possible negative social effects in an effective manner and in the spirit of solidarity. Revenues from the EU ETS, including from emissions trading in the new sectors, will also remain available to Member States to finance measures intended to improve energy efficiency, district heating systems and insulation, or to provide financial support to lower- and middle-income households.</span>

               <span>To address the social impacts arising from the emissions trading for the two new sectors of buildings and road transport, a Social Climate Fund (‘the Fund’) is created. In order to ensure that the Union budget can sustain the additional expenditure for the Fund, the Commission puts forward in parallel to this Fund Regulation proposals to amend both the Regulation for the Multiannual Financial Framework for the years 2021 to 2027 and Council Decision (EU, Euratom) 2020/2053 (‘the Own Resource Decision’). In particular, a part of the revenues from the emission trading for the road transport and buildings will accrue to the Union budget. The Fund should provide funding to Member States to support their measures and investments intended to increase energy efficiency of buildings, to carry out energy efficiency improvements, building renovation, and to decarbonise heating and cooling of buildings, including the integration of energy production from renewable energy sources and to finance zero- and low- emission mobility. Member States could also consider temporary direct support to vulnerable households alongside investments accelerating further structural change.</span>

Switching to fully electric powertrains avoids the energy losses from internal combustion engines and leads to a fraction of the final energy use per km. Reduction of energy use in the transport sector as a result of the vehicle CO</span><span>2</span><span> legislation is reflected in the quantification of the overall EU energy efficiency target. </span><span>The Energy Efficiency Directive will create synergies with the measures of the Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy. While leaving the full flexibility and discretion to the Member States regarding the choice of measures for achieving the reduction in energy use in transport, the Directive will incentives the uptake of energy efficiency measures in the transport sector. </span><span>The Circular Economy Action Plan is also complementary to the EED. Designing products and infrastructures for longer lifetimes, or re-using and recycling raw materials, leads to lower energy consumption and GHG emissions along the life-cycle of products and infrastructures. The Renovation Wave Strategy puts focus on ensuring that Europe’s buildings are more energy-efficient, less carbon-intensive over their full life-cycle and more sustainable. Circular economy principles can help reduce pollution and materials-related greenhouse gas emissions of building renovation.</span>

Furthermore, the Energy Efficiency Directive will provide the necessary framework to ensure high energy efficiency performance of products, services, works and buildings purchased by public bodies, and to consider, where appropriate, wider sustainability, social, environmental and circular economy aspects. A harmonised approach, including considering energy efficiency aspects in tendering processes, will preserve competition, ensure long-term and cost-effective energy savings and allow for continuing markets of scale. The Energy Efficiency Directive will extend the energy savings by increasing the savings rate. Member States should continue achieving new annual energy savings from policy measures across all sectors. Since the energy savings obligation is an effective measure to improve energy efficiency in various sectors, it is also an effective tool to support Member States in the alleviation of energy poverty. Thus, the energy savings obligation will require Member States to achieve an individually calculated share of the total amount of energy savings required towards vulnerable customers and final users, people affected by energy poverty and, where applicable, people living in social housing. A harmonised approach can contribute to a just energy transition for all European citizens. The energy savings obligation retains full flexibility for Member States with regard to the types of policy measures, their size, scope and content. The Energy Efficiency Directive will ensure the same level of basic contractual rights for all European citizens regarding heating, cooling and domestic hot water. Whereas the Energy Efficiency Directive will require the implementation of certain basic contractual rights of customers, the national competences would not be restricted. One level playing field across the EU is also required with regard to consumer information and awareness raising activities. Member States are required to take appropriate measures, whereas the concrete design of such actions remain at their discretion. The Union -wide impacts of economic and health crisis show that a harmonised approach is also required to empower and protect vulnerable customers and final users and those affected by energy poverty. </span>

               <span>To ensure the same level of protection and empowerment, the Energy Efficiency Directive requires to implement and finance energy efficiency improvement measures as a priority among those people, which will also support Member States in mitigating distributional effects. Network of experts will facilitate Member States´ actions in this regard and should be established in all Member States. While requiring mandatory energy audits for large enterprises, as energy savings can be significant, Member States will retain flexibility to develop programmes to encourage SMEs to undergo energy audits. Regarding the heating and cooling sector, Member States retain their competences to carry out a comprehensive assessment of the potential for high-efficiency cogeneration and efficient district heating and cooling, and may grant exemptions in the area of waste heat recovery through high-efficiency cogeneration or by supplying a district heating or cooling network. The Energy Efficiency Directive will allow Member States to introduce measures and procedures to promote cogeneration installations. To contribute to the creation of a single market, all Member States, National Regulatory Authorities, transmission and distribution system operators should apply the `Energy Efficiency First´ principle and remove all regulatory, technical and non-regulatory measures for energy efficiency improvements in the operation of energy networks. The development of a market for energy services to ensure the availability of both the demand for and the supply of energy services would remain subject to Member States´ discretion. The Energy Efficiency Directive would retain the flexibility for Member States to take action to identify and address regulatory and non-regulatory barriers for energy efficiency improvements. Member States and regions would be encouraged to make full use of the Structural and Investments Funds and other financing facilities to trigger investments in energy efficiency improvement measures, to alleviate energy poverty, and to mitigate any distributional effects on vulnerable customers and final users, people affected by energy poverty, and those living in social housing. </span>

Regarding the energy savings obligation for the public sector, public bodies are defined in the Public Procurement Directive 2014/24/EU (contracting authorities). Member States would need to establish a database with public bodies, including their annual energy consumption. The proposed energy consumption reduction obligation leaves significant flexibility to Member States as to where and how energy savings could be achieved. Given the cost-benefits that would accrue from implementing savings measures, this effort is considered effective and not excessive. The Proposal also aims to address distributional impacts from the extension of emission trading to buildings and transport. Setting definitions and obligations notably in relation to heating and cooling would be proportionate to the additional energy savings and synergies with the other instruments that could be achieved in this sector. Proportionality of additional monitoring and reporting requirements depend on the balance between increased cost and savings achieved due to a better understanding of the impacts of relevant measures.</span>

Furthermore, there is a potential for the Energy Efficiency Directive to better tackle socio-economic challenges like protecting and empowering vulnerable customers and final users and alleviating energy poverty. Regarding industries, the evaluation shows that a key barrier is likely to be that most businesses do not have the expertise to know what technical energy saving opportunities are available, or what their economic benefits might be for the business.</span>

               <span>In terms of effectiveness, the Energy Efficiency Directive has led to energy efficiency improvements across the Union thanks to its targets (notably Article 3 and Article 5) and binding measures (notably Article 7 on energy savings obligations), even though the progress in achieving the Union energy efficiency targets for 2020 was not sufficient. Achieving the necessary level of energy efficiency improvements relies largely on Member States’ ambition when setting objectives, and their efforts when developing and implementing energy efficiency measures at national level. Although the Energy Efficiency Directive sets final and primary energy consumption limits for the Union as a whole, and the Governance Regulation provides for further Union measures if the targets are not met, the indicative nature of the target does not support its achievement. Article 7 remains an effective measure responsible for generating energy savings mostly in the buildings sector. Obligations for public sector (Articles 5 and 6) proved key to demonstrate the exemplary role of central governments in promoting energy efficiency via renovations and public procurement. However, the measures were implemented at a limited scale, and a number of limitations prevent reaping energy savings potential in the public sector. The Energy Efficiency Directive was also key to promoting the use of energy audits across the Union (Article 8). However, important limitations remain such as follow up to audits and challenges related to application of the SMEs definition, lack of requirements and incentives for implementing energy management systems. The requirements of Article 14 on heating and cooling, in particular the requirement to establish comprehensive assessments, helped to increase the overall importance and awareness of heating and cooling in all Member States. However, the analysis showed that the overall impact had rather been low, in particular due to the lack of follow up given to the findings from the comprehensive assessments carried out in line with Article 14, and the wide use of exemptions allowed. The Energy Efficiency Directive largely contributed to the development of energy services markets and energy performance contracting (Article 18). However, important barriers still remain to be tackled.</span>

            <p class="Normal">
               <span>In terms of efficiency, overall, the Energy Efficiency Directive has contributed to achieving energy savings in the Union in a cost-effective manner. Several provisions subject to `conditionalities´ (e.g. in Articles 5, 6, 9-11, 14) required to act, if it is cost-effective/ economically or technically feasible. It gave significant flexibility to Member States to choose measures. However, Member States have not always demonstrated how the feasibility was established. There are no indications for significant differences in the magnitude of costs amongst the Member States for most of the provisions of the Energy Efficiency Directive, except for Article 7 (the costs depend on the design and scope of the measure).</span>

            <p class="Normal">
               <span>In terms of coherence, the Energy Efficiency Directive is overall coherent with broader energy and climate policies, however, the increasing interlinkages with renewable energy and the EU ETS require proper streamlining and closer look at reducing administrative burden. In addition, the Energy Efficiency Directive provisions need to be adapted to support the decarbonisation and zero pollution objectives in the context of the initiatives under the European Green Deal.</span>

               <span>Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action established an integrated energy and climate planning, monitoring and reporting framework, to monitor progress towards the climate and energy targets in line with the transparency requirements of the Paris Agreement. Member States had to submit to the Commission their integrated national energy and climate plans by the end of 2019, covering the five dimensions of the Energy Union for the period 2021-2030. Member States must report biennially on the progress made in implementing the plans and in addition, by 30 June 2023 they must notify the Commission of their draft updates of the plans, with the final updates due on 30 June 2024. This update would cover any new targets agreed in the revision of EED. This reporting system under the Governance Regulation is considered to have been effective in monitoring Member States’ progress towards the Union and national level energy efficiency energy contributions.  </span>

               <span>The main provisions which substantially change Directive 2012/27/EU or add new elements are the following:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Articles 1 and 4 set an increased Union binding energy efficiency target for final and primary consumption, as well as indicative national energy efficiency contributions and provides a formula to Member States to calculate their contributions. The Union targets are set in terms of the level of final and primary energy consumption to be achieved in 2030 and the level of ambition is expressed by comparing these levels to the 2020 Reference Scenario projections for 2030. The level of ambition expressed in such way reflects additional efforts compared to the efforts that are in place or indicated in the National Energy and Climate Plans. Comparisons to the previous baseline that is the 2007 Reference Scenario projections for 2030 and historical values from 2005 are kept in the recitals. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>National contributions remain indicative given strong opposition by the majority of Member States towards binding national targets expressed in the public consultation and in other fora. However, benchmarks and new delivery gap mechanisms are proposed complementing those that were proposed in the Governance Regulation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Article 3 introduces a new provision on the Energy Efficiency First principle, to provide the legal basis for the application of the principle, while minimising the administrative burden. It includes an obligation to consider energy efficiency solutions in policy and investment decisions in energy systems and non-energy sectors, including social housing.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Article 5 introduces an obligation for the public sector to reduce its energy consumption for public services and installations of public bodies. This can be reached in any subsector of the public sector, including transport, public buildings, spatial planning and water and waste management amongst others.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Article 6 </span><span>broadens the scope of the renovation obligation. The obligation will now be applied to all public bodies at all administration levels and in all sectors of public bodies’ activities, including healthcare, education and public housing, where the buildings are owned by public bodies. This will bring the benefits of public buildings renovation closer to all people in all Member States and it will multiply the renovations in the public sector. Article 6 aims at renovations meeting the Near Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB) standard, which is an enhanced cost effective standard for renovations. The renovation rate remains at least 3%, which is the lowest common denominator for a minimum renovation rate, while it is recognised that some Member States, regions and cities have already adopted higher renovation requirements and standards in the public sector. Finally, the alternatives that allowed Member States to reach similar energy savings through other measures than renovations are deleted. Such measures can continue counting for the energy savings obligations under Article 8 and contribute to the achievements of the obligation under Article 8. Article 6 aims at renovations in line with the Renovation Wave Strategy. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Article 7 strengthens the public procurement provisions by extending the obligation to take into account the energy efficiency requirements by all public administration levels, and by removing conditionalities with regard to cost-effectiveness, technical and economic feasibility. The amendments will include a provision that Member States may require that public bodies consider where appropriate circular economy aspects and green public procurement criteria in public procurement practices. Member States will be required to support public bodies by providing guidelines and methodologies on the assessment of lifecycle costs, and by putting in place competence support centres and encouraging using aggregated procurement and digital procurement. Member States would be required to publish information </span><span>on wining tenders (in line with the thresholds set out in the public procurement directives).</span>

            <p class="Normal">
               <span>As part of the exemplary role of the public sector Article 7 also includes a provision that contracting authorities may require that tenders disclose a Global Warming Potential of new buildings (numeric indicator in kgCO2e/m² (of useful internal floor area) for each life cycle stage averaged for one year of a reference study period of 50 years), in particular for new buildings above 2000 square meters. It is linked to a provision aimed at increasing awareness to circular economy and whole life-cycle of carbon emissions in public procurement practices.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Amendments to Article 8 increase</span><span> the annual energy savings obligation to 1.5% for all Member States (including Cyprus and Malta), and includes specific requirements for the alleviation of energy poverty. It requires to implement policy measures as a priority among vulnerable customers and final users, people affected by energy poverty and, where applicable, people living in social housing, and to make best possible use of public funding and, where applicable, to consider the use of revenues of ETS allowances. Article 8 requires Member States to ensure that national policy mix has no adverse effects on vulnerable customers and final users, people affected by energy poverty and, where applicable, people living in social housing and that those policies effectively alleviate and reduce energy poverty. Article 8 requires Member States to achieve a share of the total amount of required end-use energy savings among vulnerable customers and final users, people affected by energy poverty and, where applicable, people living in social housing. Article 8 establishes a delivery gap mechanism regarding the required amount of energy savings to be achieved in a given obligation period. The energy savings obligation does not foresee the application of the flexibilities to calculate the required amount of energy savings alternatively as of 1 January 2024 (Article 8(6) to (9)). Article 9 includes transmission system operators as potential obligated parties, and allows Member States to require obligated parties to achieve an amount of energy savings among vulnerable customers and final users, people affected by energy poverty and, where applicable, people living in social housing. Annex V excludes the accountability of energy saving from policy measures regarding the use of direct fossil fuel combustion technologies, and clarifies that a reduction of the energy use through measures under the ETS Directive cannot count towards the fulfilment of the energy savings obligation, and strengthens the additionality requirement regarding taxation measures.</span>

            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Article 11 shifts the criterion for energy audits and energy management systems from the type of enterprises to the levels of energy consumption and requires a sign off of the audit recommendations by the management of the company. It also requires energy management systems for the largest energy using companies, which are likely to be more effective at ensuring that more cost saving energy saving investments will be made while probably having a lower overall cost burden on the company. Finally, the Article introduces an obligation for the monitoring of the energy performance of data centres with the aim of later establishing a set of “data centre sustainability indicators”.</span>

Energy efficiency is a valuable means to address these challenges. It improves the Union’s security of supply by reducing primary energy consumption and decreasing energy imports. It helps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in a cost-effective way and thereby to mitigate climate change. Shifting to a more energy-efficient economy should also accelerate the spread of innovative technological solutions and improve the competitiveness of industry in the Union, boosting economic growth and creating high quality jobs in several sectors related to energy efficiency.</span>

Energy efficiency in the transport sector was considered in parallel in the White Paper on Transport, adopted on 28 March 2011.

               <span class="CRDeleted">An assessment of the possibility of establishing a ‘white certificate’ scheme at Union level has shown that, in the current situation, such a system would create excessive administrative costs and that there is a risk that energy savings would be concentrated in a number of Member States and not introduced across the Union. The objective of such a Union-level scheme could be better achieved, at least at this stage, by means of national energy efficiency obligation schemes for energy utilities or other alternative policy measures that achieve the same amount of energy savings. It is appropriate for the level of ambition of such schemes to be established in a common framework at Union level while providing significant flexibility to Member States to take fully into account the national organisation of market actors, the specific context of the energy sector and final customers’ habits. The common framework should give energy utilities the option of offering energy services to all final customers, not only to those to whom they sell energy. This increases competition in the energy market because energy utilities can differentiate their product by providing complementary energy services. The common framework should allow Member States to include requirements in their national scheme that pursue a social aim, in particular in order to ensure that vulnerable customers have access to the benefits of higher energy efficiency. Member States should determine, on the basis of objective and non-discriminatory criteria, which energy distributors or retail energy sales companies should be obliged to achieve the end-use energy savings target laid down in this Directive.</span>

As a means of supporting national energy efficiency initiatives, obligated parties under national energy efficiency obligation schemes could fulfil their obligations by contributing annually to an Energy Efficiency National Fund an amount that is equal to the investments required under the scheme.</span>

The energy savings obligation aims at strengthening the response to climate change by promoting incentives to Member States to implement a sustainable and clean policy mix, which is resilient, and mitigates climate change. Therefore, energy savings from policy measures regarding the use of direct fossil fuel combustion will not be eligible energy savings under energy savings obligation as of transposition of this Directive. It will allow aligning the energy savings obligation with the objectives of the European Green Deal, the Climate Target Plan, the Renovation Wave Strategy, and mirror the need for action identified by the IEA in its net zero report</span><span class="FootnoteReference">

It is important that Member States provide a clear policy framework and investment certainty to market actors. The implementation of the calculation methodology under energy savings obligation should allow all market actors to adapt their technologies in a reasonable timeframe. Where Member States support the uptake of efficient fossil fuel technologies or early replacement of such technology, for example through subsidy schemes or energy efficiency obligation schemes, energy savings may not be eligible anymore under the energy savings obligation. While energy savings resulting, for example, from the promotion of natural gas-based cogeneration would not be eligible, the restriction would not apply for indirect fossil fuel usage, for example where the electricity production includes fossil fuel generation. Policy measures targeting behavioural changes to reduce the consumption of fossil fuel, for example through information campaigns, eco-driving, should remain eligible. The energy savings from policy measures targeting building renovations may contain measures such as a replacement of fossil fuel heating systems together with building fabric improvements, which should be limited to those technologies that allow achieving the required energy savings according to the national building codes established in a Member State. Nevertheless, Member States should promote upgrading heating systems as part of deep renovations in line with the long-term objective of carbon neutrality, i.e. reducing the heating demand and covering the remaining heating demand with a carbon-free energy source.</span>

The change in the Eurostat energy balance calculation methodology and improvements in subsequent modelling projections call for a change of the baseline. Thus, using the same approach to define the target, that is to say comparing it to the future baseline projections, the ambition of the Union’s 2030 energy efficiency target is set compared to the 2020 Reference Scenario projections for 2030 reflecting national contributions from the NECPs. With that updated baseline, the Union will need to further increase its energy efficiency ambition by at least 9 % in 2030 compared to the level of efforts under the 2020 Reference Scenario. The new way of expressing the level of ambition for the Union’s targets does not affect the actual level of efforts needed.</span>
