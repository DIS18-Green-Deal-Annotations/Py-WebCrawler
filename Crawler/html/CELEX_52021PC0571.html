It reaffirms the Commission’s ambition to increase its climate targets and make Europe the first climate-neutral continent by 2050. Furthermore, it aims to protect the health and well-being of citizens from environment-related risks and impacts. The necessity and value of the European Green Deal have only grown in light of the very severe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health, living and working conditions and well-being of the Union’s citizens.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Tackling climate change is an urgent challenge. In line with the scientific findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report, global net-zero CO2 emissions need to be achieved around 2050, and neutrality for all other greenhouse gases as soon as possible later in the century. This urgent challenge requires the EU to step up its action and demonstrate global leadership by becoming climate neutral by 2050. This objective is set out in the Communication ‘</span><span>A Clean Planet for all</span><span>’ - A European strategic long-term vision for a prosperous, modern, competitive and climate-neutral economy’</span><span class="FootnoteReference">

               <span>Based on the European Green Deal strategy and a comprehensive impact assessment, the Commission’s Communication of September 2020 on </span><span>Stepping up Europe’s 2030 climate ambition</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref4" href="#footnote4">3</a>
               </span><span> (‘2030 Climate Target Plan’) proposed to raise the EU's ambition and put forward a comprehensive plan to increase the European Union’s binding target for 2030 towards at least 55 % net emission reduction, in a responsible way. Raising the 2030 ambition now helps give certainty to policymakers and investors, so that decisions made in the coming years do not lock in emission levels inconsistent with the EU’s objective to be climate neutral by 2050. The 2030 target is in line with the Paris Agreement objective to keep the global temperature increase to well below 2°C and pursue efforts to keep it to 1.5°C. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The European Council endorsed the new EU binding target for 2030 at its meeting of December 2020</span><span class="FootnoteReference">

               </span><span>. It also called on the Commission “</span><span>to assess how all economic sectors can best contribute to the 2030 target and to make the necessary proposals, accompanied by an in-depth examination of the environmental, economic and social impact at Member State level, taking into account national energy and climate plans and reviewing existing flexibilities</span><span>”.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>To this end, the </span><span>European Climate Law</span><span class="FootnoteReference">

               </span><span>, as agreed with the co-legislators, will make the EU’s climate neutrality target legally binding, and raise the 2030 ambition by setting the target of at least 55 % net emission reduction by 2030 compared to 1990. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>In order to follow the pathway proposed in the European Climate Law, and deliver this increased level of ambition for 2030, the Commission has reviewed the climate and energy legislation currently in place that are expected to only reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 % by 2030 and by 60 % by 2050. This ‘fit for 55’ legislative package, as announced in the 2030 Climate Target Plan, is the most comprehensive building block in the efforts to implement the ambitious new 2030 climate target, and all economic sectors and policies will need to make their contribution. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>As part of this package, the Commission has to increase the environmental contribution of the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) by amending Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council</span><span class="FootnoteReference">

In addition, </span><span>unprecedented near term investments are needed to overcome the negative impact of the COVID-19 crisis on jobs, incomes and businesses, including in the sectors covered by the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>To address the structural imbalance between the supply of and demand for allowances in the market and to improve the resilience of the EU ETS to major shocks, Decision (EU) 2015/1814 of the European Parliament and of the Council</span><span class="FootnoteReference">

               <span>The reserve functions by triggering adjustments to the annual auction volumes. In order to preserve a maximum degree of predictability, Decision (EU) 2015/1814 (MSR Decision) established clear rules for placing allowances in the reserve and releasing them from it. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>These rules were amended by Directive (EU) 2018/410 of the European Parliament and of the Council</span><span class="FootnoteReference">

               </span><span>. Directive (EU) 2018/410 doubled until 2023 the intake rate (the percentage from the total number of allowances in circulation (TNAC) which is put in the reserve) from 12 % to 24 %, and the minimum amount to be placed in the reserve from 100 to 200 million allowances. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>It should be noted that the minimum amount of allowances to be placed in the reserve determines indirectly the minimum TNAC necessary to trigger an intake of allowances in the reserve (i.e. the upper threshold of the reserve). The TNAC needs to be at least 833 million so that 12 % of that amount entails placing at least 100 million allowances into the reserve. This minimum amount was doubled together with the doubling of the intake percentage so that the upper threshold of the reserve stayed the same (24 % of 833 being 200).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The changes to the EU ETS to increase ambition for 2030, as well as the impact of external factors such as COVID-19 or national measures such as coal phase-outs, mean that the basic rules of the MSR must remain fit to continue tackling structural supply-demand imbalances throughout the decade. Moreover, Article 3 of the MSR Decision tasks the Commission with reviewing the functioning of the MSR before within three years of the start of its operation, on the basis of an analysis of the orderly functioning of the European carbon market. The review must pay particular attention to the MSR’s key numerical parameters and invalidation rule</span><span class="FootnoteReference">

            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The analysis carried out in the Impact Assessment, in the context of the review, shows that the MSR should be adapted to the new policy and market conditions, and shocks. It also found that the MSR should include supply and demand from aviation. Another point resulting from the analysis was that the intake is prone to a threshold effect, which should be corrected</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref11" href="#footnote11">10</a>

            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The review of these elements should be considered together with the effects for market stability of increasing the ambition of the EU ETS. As a result, it is</span><span> being carried out as part of the proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and the Council amending the EU ETS Directive and MSR Decision to strengthen the EU ETS</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref12" href="#footnote12">11</a>

            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>According to Article 1(5) of the MSR Decision, the intake rate reverts back to 12 % after 2023. If the MSR parameters are not adjusted appropriately and in a timely manner, this risks resulting in a potentially harmful increase of the surplus. Hence, the continuation of the current parameters of the MSR, as established pursuant to Directive (EU) 2018/410 (intake rate of 24 % and minimum amount to be placed in the reserve of 200 million allowances), should be adopted separately from the general review of the EU ETS as part of the “Fit for 55” package to ensure market predictability.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>As a result, the MSR Decision should be amended to make this essential adjustment to maintain a well-functioning and ambitious EU ETS. </span>

               <span>The EU's right to act stems from the fact that the EU ETS operates as a Union-wide system in a fully harmonised manner. The EU ETS Directive is an existing EU policy instrument introduced in 2003. </span>

            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Climate change is a trans-boundary problem and both international and EU action can effectively complement and reinforce regional, national and local action. Increasing the 2030 target for EU greenhouse gas reductions will impact many sectors across the EU economy and coordinated action at the EU level is therefore indispensable and has a much bigger chance of leading to the necessary transformation, acting as a strong driver for cost-efficient change and upward convergence. </span>

By extension, as the MSR is a tool for stability of the market established by the EU ETS Directive, its objective also cannot be sufficiently achieved by unilateral action by the Member States. It is an existing EU policy instrument adopted in 2015.

               <span>The MSR has wide support across stakeholder groups, however, there is no consensus about the necessary changes to its parameters, in particular its thresholds and its intake rate. Civil society expressed relatively more support for a strengthening of the parameters of the MSR than the private sector. The proposal to continue with an intake rate of 24 % and minimum amount to be placed in the reserve of 200 million allowances beyond 2023 and until the end of Phase IV of the EU Emissions Trading System in 2030 strikes a reasonable balance, also reflecting that the MSR with its current parameters has worked well in the past.</span>

               <span>The EU ETS generates significant revenues for Member States’ budgets. Most of the auctioning revenues accrue to Member States. The proposal affects national budgets and administrations primarily because of this link. Maintaining the current intake rate of the MSR will reduce the auction volumes of the Member States. However, this is expected to be compensated by the effect on the price of a reduced surplus of allowances in the market due to the increased ambition of the EU ETS, and by the proposed increase in the scope of the EU ETS Directive to cover maritime transport, and road transport and buildings. Adjustments to the EU budgetary framework will be presented by the Commission as part of the upcoming Own Resources package including a proposal to amend the multiannual financial framework.</span>
