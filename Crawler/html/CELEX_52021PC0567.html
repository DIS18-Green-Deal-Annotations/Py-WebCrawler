            <p class="Body">
               <span class="Hyperlink1">This proposal introduces an amendment to aviation rules in the Emissions Trading System of the European Union (EU ETS) to implement Member States’ notification to EU-based airlines of the offsetting for the year 2021 under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Body">
               <span class="Hyperlink1">The objective is to implement this notification in a manner that minimises the administrative burden of national authorities and airline operators, and provides legal certainty as regards CORSIA offsetting by airlines based in Member States.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Body">

                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref2" href="#footnote2">1</a>
               </span><span>. The CORSIA review in 2022 will </span><span>examine the impact of COVID-19 on CORSIA on various issues.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Body">
               <span class="Hyperlink1">Subject to the differences notified in 2018</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref3" href="#footnote3">2</a>
               </span><span class="Hyperlink1"> and the manner in which the European Parliament and Council amend Union legislation, the EU intends to implement CORSIA. Therefore, EU-based airlines should surrender credits if relevant to comply with CORSIA offsetting in respect of their 2021 emissions. As foreseen in the CORSIA standards and recommended practices, EU Member States should calculate and inform airlines of their offsetting in respect of 2021 emissions by 30 November 2022; thereafter, those airlines should cancel the according number of credits by 31 January 2025.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Body">
               <span class="Hyperlink1">Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, aviation ETS CO</span><span class="Hyperlink1">2</span><span class="Hyperlink1"> emissions decreased in 2020 by 64% compared to 2019</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref4" href="#footnote4">3</a>
               </span><span class="Hyperlink1">. </span><span> In November 2020, the European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation (Eurocontrol) published its forecast for the recovery of the European aviation sector for the years 2020-2024</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref5" href="#footnote5">4</a>
               </span><span>. It describes the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on air traffic. According to the forecast, even in the most optimistic scenario, the 2019 emission levels would not be reached before 2024, whereas the worst-case scenario predicts such recovery by 2029.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Body">
               <span class="Hyperlink1">While estimates do not foresee any actual CORSIA offsetting requirements during the period 2021-2023, there should nonetheless be a legal obligation in Union law for Member States to notify the offsetting figures to EU-based airlines by 30 November 2022 in respect of emissions during 2021. Based on the above factual evidence about 2020 and the first half of 2021, the likelihood for any actual CORSIA offsetting requirements materialising in respect of 2021 is minimal, and is also very low in respect of 2022. Therefore, this proposal foresees that once it is clear what the additional offsetting figure in respect of the year 2021 is, most likely: zero, Member States shall, during the course of 2022, communicate this to airlines. This proposal should be adopted by Council and the European Parliament once the emissions data for 2021 will be known, that is after 1 January 2022.</span>

            <p class="Body">
               <span class="Hyperlink1">The same approach will be taken in respect of subsequent years in the event that the relevant ‘Fit for 55’ proposals are not yet adopted.</span>

               <span class="Hyperlink1">EU-based airlines’ ETS obligations remain in force as in Union law pursuant to Directive 2003/87/EC.

               <span>Climate change is a trans-boundary problem and EU action can effectively complement and reinforce regional, national and local action. Coordination of climate action should be taken at European level and, where possible, effective action should be facilitated at global level. EU action is justified on grounds of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty of the European Union. Since 1992, the European Union has worked to develop joint solutions and drive forward global action to tackle climate change. More specifically, action at EU level will provide for cost effective delivery of the 2030 and long-term emission reduction objectives while ensuring fairness and environmental integrity. Articles 191 to 193 of the TFEU confirm and specify EU competencies in the area of climate change. </span>
