            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The European Green Deal (EGD) establishes the objective of becoming climate neutral in 2050 in a manner that contributes to the European economy, growth and jobs. This objective </span><span>requires a greenhouse as emissions reduction of 55% </span><span>by 2030 as confirmed by the European Council in December 2020. This in turn requires significantly higher shares of renewable energy sources in an integrated energy system. The current EU target of at least 32% renewable energy by 2030, set in the Renewable Energy Directive (REDII), is not sufficient and needs to be increased to 38-40%, according to the Climate Target Plan (CTP). At the same time, new accompanying measures in different sectors in line with the Energy System Integration, the Hydrogen, the Offshore Renewable Energy and the Biodiversity Strategies are required to achieve this increased target.  </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The overall objectives of the revision of REDII are to achieve an increase in the use of energy from renewable sources by 2030, to foster better energy system integration and to contribute to climate and environmental objectives including the protection of biodiversity, thereby addressing the intergenerational concerns associated with global warming and biodiversity loss. This revision of REDII is essential to achieve the increased climate target as well as to protect our environment and health, reduce our energy dependency, and contribute to the EU’s technological and industrial leadership along with the creation of jobs and economic growth.</span>

               <span>A cost-efficient accelerated development of sustainable renewable energy within a more integrated energy system cannot be sufficiently achieved by Member States alone. An EU approach is needed to provide the right incentives to Member States with different levels of ambition to accelerate, in a coordinated way, the energy transition from the traditional fossil fuel based energy system towards a more integrated and more energy-efficient energy system based on renewables-based generation. Taking into account the different energy policies and priorities among Member States, action at EU level is more likely to achieve the required increased deployment of renewables than national or local action alone. </span>

               <span>EU action on renewable energy brings added value because it is more efficient and effective than individual Member States’ actions, avoiding a fragmented approach by addressing the transition of the European energy system in a coordinated way. It ensures net reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and pollution, protects biodiversity, harnesses the benefits of the internal market, fully exploits the advantages of economies of scale and technological cooperation in Europe, and it gives investors certainty in an EU-wide regulatory framework. The achievement of an increased share of renewable energy in final EU energy consumption depends on national contributions from each Member State. These will be more ambitious and cost-effective if driven by an agreed common legal and policy framework.</span>

Most responses came from companies or business associations, followed by NGOs, anonymous and citizens. In addition, the Commission launched an online public consultation (OPC) on 17 November 2020 for 12 weeks, in line with the Commission Better Regulation rules. It contains multiple choice and open questions covering a wide range of issues on the revision of REDII. 39,046 replies were received in total.

Transport and heating and cooling were the two most popular sectors where additional efforts were considered necessary, with a majority supporting increased targets for both sectors at least at the level of the CTP. A coordinated response of more than 38,000 participants requested removing biomass from the list of renewable resources and limiting the use for bioenergy to locally available waste and residues, whereas representatives from trade unions, business and a majority of public authorities preferred not changing the current sustainability criteria for biomass.</span>

               <span>Impact assessment</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The Impact Assessment (IA) accompanying the Proposal was elaborated based on modelling, stakeholder input and input from the Interservice Group. The report was submitted to the Regulatory Scrutiny Board on the 10 of March 2021. On 19 April 2021, the Regulatory Scrutiny Board delivered its first opinion on the Impact Assessment, and following the re-submission of the IA, the second was delivered on 19 May. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Against this background, the impact assessment  analysed the various options through which a revision of the REDII could effectively and efficiently contribute to the delivery of the updated target as part of a wider “Fit for 55” policy package. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Regarding the </span><span>overall renewable energy target</span><span> level, option 0 (no change) would provide no means of ensuring that the EU-wide renewable energy target is deployed to reach at least 38-40% share in final energy consumption. Option 2 (a higher target than 40%) would potentially lead to overshooting the climate target and to a lack of coherence with other EU legislative instruments. Hence, option 1 (a minimum target in the range of 38-40%) has no drawbacks and is the thus the preferred and effective option. Regarding the nature of the target, although option 1 (national binding targets) would imply the most effective achievement of an increased RES share, this would create subsidiarity issues. The current Energy Union Governance process is an important foundation for achieving the renewables target. The first iteration of the review process of the national plans, completed in 2020, proved to be effective in that the national contributions were collectively sufficiently ambitious to reach the binding Union 2030 RES target. Under the Governance Regulation the Member States must submit their draft updates to their NECPs by June 2023, and can already show how they are planning to reach the higher target 2030 target. Given the effective nature and architecture of the current system, option 0 (maintaining the EU binding target and national voluntary contributions) is the preferred option.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Text2">
               <span>Regarding </span><span>heating &amp; cooling</span><span>, option 1 (non-regulatory measures) will not trigger Member States to increase efforts in the RES heating and cooling sector to at least 1.1% annual average percentage point (pp). Translating the  EU RES heating and cooling figure from the CTP  into a binding uniform increased annual average share across Member States equally as per option 3b is not considered proportionate, although it is the most effective. </span><span>The level of renewables needed in 2030 could also be set as a target as proposed in option 3c but that would depart from the current model and could disrupt the already on-going implementation efforts, although it would have the added benefit of setting the end-goal in 2030 clearly. Option 3a combined with sector and EU RES buildings and industry benchmarks of appropriate design (option 3d) would be effective in providing the right mix of drivers for integrating further</span><span> </span><span>these sectors into the energy system</span><span>.</span><span> This option 3a would set a minimum flat rate of RES growth by making the current indicative annual increase target of 1.1 p.p. as the minimum required effort and complement it with Member State specific “top-ups” redistributing the additional efforts to the desired level of renewables in 2030 among Member States based on GDP and cost. The additional Member States specific increase rates could provide a means of assessing the relative level of ambition of each Member States in the heating and cooling sector but also as a potential gap filler measure to close the gap, if other sectors than heating and cooling would fail to deliver the 38-40% overall RES target. The option of a benchmark for the use of renewable energy in the building sector is also considered here.</span>

         <div class="content">
            <p class="Text2">
               <span>The extended list of measures as per option 2a allows flexibility at national level and ensures proportionality</span><span> and gives the Member States a toolbox to choose from</span><span>. The design respects national and local diversities in conditions and starting points, and provide a clear framework for actors at all levels (national, regional, local) and of all types (from utilities and companies to municipalities to citizen consumers/prosumers).  </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Regarding </span><span>district heating &amp; cooling</span><span>, </span><span>option 3c (</span><span>increasing the indicative 1% annual increase percentage-point target to CTP levels of 2.1% without changing its nature)</span><span> would steer district heating developments towards integrating more renewable energy in coherence with the CTP and carbon-neutrality goals, while respecting the wide variety of situations in Member States. Option 3b (</span><span>indicative EU renewable target for renewables’ share in district heating &amp; cooling</span><span> could give similar benefits as option 3c but departs from the current provisions and could be disruptive for already ongoing implementation. Option 3d (</span><span>increasing the 1% percentagepoint increase target and making it binding</span><span>) would be the most effective target design, but is too stringent and leaves less room for Member States. Option 3a (</span><span>no changes) </span><span>would make it possible for district heating to indefinitely continue with the fossil fuels and thus is not coherent with the review’s objectives. Option 2 (list of measures) can be self-standing or complementary, as it gives a clearer enabling framework to transform district heating and cooling, make it into an enabler of renewable energy supply in buildings and to become a key heat decarbonisation instrument, while enhancing energy sector integration in national and EU energy systems. Combining option 2 on measures with the target design in option 3c is the preferred option to ensure that district heating and cooling aligns with the EGD  and becomes an enabler to deliver on the CTP and energy system integration  goals. Together with the options on overall heating and cooling and buildings, this option would also set an enabling framework to develop and expand modern renewable based smart district heating and cooling systems.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Regarding </span><span>mainstreaming renewable electricity</span><span>, option 1.1 (availability of near-real-time information on the renewable share of electricity supplied by the grid) would provide  effective market incentivising signals that relate directly to renewable penetration and carbon reduction, without any administrative burden and in coherence with existing legislation. Option 1.2 (information on the RES-share and GHG emission profile would have some positive effects on consumer information, however it would otherwise bring limited added value. Options 2.1-2.3 cover different aspects of optimising the intelligent charging infrastructure, with varying levels of positive contribution to overall implementation costs and benefits to the economy. In order to provide flexibility to Member States, implementation based on national assessment was in each case selected as the preferred solution revolving around smart charging functionality, including bidirectional charging and deployment of additional smart charging points (2.1B, 2.2B and 2.3). Options 3.1-3.3 address various obstacles in the aggregation and mobility service provision market which hinder competition. Option 3.1 (ensuring that the treatment of electricity storage systems or devices by network and market operators is not discriminatory or disproportionate irrespective of their size (small-scale vs large-scale) or whether they are stationary or mobile, so that they are able to competitively offer flexibility and balancing services) is a no-regrets option. Option 3.2 (independent aggregators and mobility service providers</span><span class="normaltextrun"> to have access</span><span> to basic battery information, such as state-of-health and state-of-charge) is necessary in setting a level playing field and its early implementation would bring positive long term effects in the availability, quality and cost of services provided to domestic battery owners and electric vehicle (EV) users. Option 3.3 (ensure open access to all publicly accessible charging infrastructure) is expected to become increasingly beneficial with the proliferation of EVs.</span>

            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Of the options considered regarding the </span><span>increase of renewable energy in the</span><span> </span><span>transport sector</span><span>, a combination of option 1B (in addition to the increase of the target and the sub-target for advanced biofuels a dedicated sub-target for renewable fuels of non-biological origin is introduced) with options 2A (energy-based obligation fuel suppliers</span><span>)</span><span>, 2C (</span><span>the choice between the approaches described under 2A and 2B (</span><span>emissions-based obligation fuel suppliers</span><span>) is left to the Member States </span><span>or 2D (emissions-based obligation fuel suppliers</span><span> but operators are required to achieve minimum shares for advanced biofuels and renewable fuels of non-biological origin)</span><span> would perform the best overall. While all options apart from option 1 deliver on the needed level of ambition, there are substantial differences. The energy-based options may have the advantage to promote the development and production of innovative renewable and recycled carbon fuels as they provide the most predictable and stable policy framework for investments into such technologies. The GHG-intensity based options can stimulate supply chain improvements and technology efficiency in renewable and low carbon fuels, where costs of production are higher and would have the advantage of ensuring consistency with the approach chosen under the Fuel Quality Directive. This, however, would require applying changes to the methodology applied to determine the GHG emission intensity.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Text2">
               <span>Promoting the use of renewable fuels of non-biological origin </span><span>is fully in line with the Energy System Integration Strategy and the Hydrogen Strategy as well as the CTP especially if considering the post-2030 perspective. This is in particular valid for option 1 (extension of the scope of accounting of RFNBOs beyond transport and improvement of the consistency of accounting of RFNBOs) and option 3 (creation of specific sub-targets for RFNBOs in hard-to-decarbonise sectors). Specific but realistic sub-targets for RFNBOs for the transport and industry sectors in 2030 would be a first step for their larger scale development after 2030.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Text2">
               <span>Regarding the </span><span>certification</span><span> of renewable and low carbon fuels, option 1a (adjustment of the scope and content of the current certification system to include all fuels covered by REDII including recycled carbon fuels) and option 2A (further development of the existing system of guarantees of origin as an alternative certification system) were assessed. Option 1a was considered to have good potential to strengthen the existing system, with the certification of low-carbon fuels to be addressed in a separate legislative proposal such as the Hydrogen and Decarbonised Gas Market Package. IT development choices will be subject to pre-approval by the European Commission Information Technology and Cybersecurity Board.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Regarding the options to ensure </span><span>bioenergy sustainability</span><span>, option 1 (non-regulatory measures) would facilitate the implementation of the REDII sustainability criteria, but would not include additional safeguards to address the identified risks. Option 2 (targeted strengthening of the current EU bioenergy sustainability criteria) would provide the most direct safeguard against the risks of production of forest biomass in high biodiversity areas. It would also introduce additional safeguards promoting optimal lifecycle GHG emissions saving and avoiding new inefficient biomass use in the power sector. Option 3 (regulation of small installations) would further add to the effectiveness of option 2 by regulating a larger amount of biomass use for energy in the EU. It would also help improve public monitoring of biomass production and use. Building on the preferred options 2, 3 and 4.2 (requiring Member States to design their support schemes for biomass fuels in a way to minimise market distortions in the raw materials market, with the aim to minimise the use of high quality roundwood), would contribute to minimising the use of whole trees for energy production as set out in the EU Biodiversity Strategy. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>In addition to the core objectives of the revision of REDII to address the insufficient ambition in a 2030 and 2050 perspective, to address the insufficient system integration, and to update bioenergy sustainability provisions, a limited number of </span><span>additional “flanking” or enabling measures</span><span> could contribute to the cost-efficient deployment of renewables.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Regarding </span><span>Power Purchase Agreements</span><span> (PPAs), option 1 (guidelines) will provide additional guidance to Member States without increasing administrative burden, although the effectiveness will depend on the uptake of these guidelines. Option 2 (financial support for the use of PPAs for small and medium-sized enterprises) will have a positive benefit for the uptake of renewables and the European economy. Option 3 (strengthening of regulatory measures on PPAs) would place additional burden upon Member States to remove any undue barriers, but could provide additional certainty for producers and consumers of renewable electricity. Options 1 and 2 are considered the preferred combination.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Regarding </span><span>cross-border cooperation</span><span>, option 1 (updated Commission guidance) would, by itself, not be very effective whereas option 2 (obligation for Member States to test cross-border cooperation within the next 3 years) has a moderate effectiveness. Although option 3 (mandatory partial opening of support schemes) and option 4 (enhanced use of the Union renewable energy financing mechanism) would be highly effective, option 2 is expected to be more politically acceptable and thus the preferred option.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Regarding the promotion of </span><span>offshore energy</span><span>, given the binding nature of option 1 (joint planning) it would be very effective to ensure target setting and implementation per sea basin. Option 2 (introduction of single contact points for the permitting per sea basin) can be expected to have good effectiveness of facilitating permitting of cross-border offshore renewables projects. A combination of both options is preferred.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Regarding </span><span>industry</span><span>, option 0 (no changes) is not expected to increase the share of renewable energy consumption in the industry sector, creating serious concerns regarding the objective to reduce greenhouse gas emission reductions by 2030, and to achieve climate neutrality in 2050. Option 1 (introduction of use of renewable energy in the audits required in the EED) would provide an effective means to introduce industrial actors to existing cost-effective solutions to switch to renewable energy, without any administrative burden and in coherence with existing legislation. Option 2 (labelling for  industrial products in certain sectors claimed to be made from renewable energy) provides an effective means to create a uniform and coherent market for those companies that are placing products and services produced from renewable energy on the market. Any mandatory labelling would need to be carefully designed to ensure compatibility with WTO rules. Options 1 and 2 would be complementary and the most effective options, combined with an indicative target for the use of renewable energy in industry.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Overall the policy options have positive economic, environmental and societal benefits. A more secure EU energy system, less dependent on imports, would be achieved by the increase in renewable energy, in particular from offshore. The revision of REDII is likely to have positive impacts on economic growth and investments, by creating quality jobs, and reducing fossil fuel imports and energy costs for consumers and business. Many of the policy options are projected to create jobs, in line with the envisaged green digital recovery. Positive employment effects are expected, especially in sectors linked to renewable energy, with an increase in employment and skills in the construction and energy supply sectors and shift in employment between the sectors. Per euro of expenditure, renewable energy creates nearly 70 per cent more jobs than fossil fuels spending and solar PV creates more than twice the number of jobs per unit of electricity generation compared to coal or natural gas. Greater use of energy from sustainable renewable sources, including renewable hydrogen, would result in reduced GHG emissions. Replacing fossil fuels will also reduce air pollutants and have a beneficial impact on health. Renewable-based electrification of road transport would have positive impacts in particular on urban air pollution, whereas electrification of, for example, heating in buildings, would contribute substantially to reducing the GHG and other air pollutant emissions from the European building stock, which today relies heavily on fossil fuels. Air quality in cities will be improved by among others renewable heating, especially district heating in cities. Positive biodiversity impacts will follow from stronger sustainability criteria for bioenergy. It may reduce import from outside the EU of biomass fuels, as third countries choose not to comply with them and redirect their export away from the EU.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The revision of the REDII will mainly entail practical implications for Member States public administrations given the need to comply with higher (binding) targets which need to be worked towards to and monitored accordingly. Other actions required from the public administration include promotion and facilitation of the uptake of renewable energy across multiple carriers.  </span>

            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>A regulatory fitness programme (REFIT) evaluation of the Renewable Energy Directive was carried out between 2014 and 2016. Given the relatively recent adoption of REDII, the proposed revision is limited to what is considered necessary to contribute in a cost-effective way to the Union’s 2030 climate ambition, and is not a full revision of the Directive. The Impact Assessment identified possibilities for simplification of legislation and reduction of regulatory costs.</span>

               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>Increasing renewable energy use in heating and cooling and in buildings will require building works/renovation, leading to an increase in employment in the sector. Up to 95% of construction, architecture and civil engineering firms are small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), so there is a likely positive economic effect on SMEs. Guidance and financial support on power purchase agreements will help SMEs who do not have the resources to deal with complex contracts. More stringent forest biomass criteria may create increased administrative costs and burden for small and medium-sized economic operators.</span>
               </p>
               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>To ensure fair competition in the single market the same rules should apply to all economic operators. As such, the proposal does not exempt SMEs or micro-enterprises except for providing simplified verification mechanisms for small energy producing installations. However, the envisaged economic impacts also likely to benefit SMEs as most of the value chain of deploying renewable energy technology, in particular solar PV, is operated by SMEs.</span>

For this, they should grant no support to the production of energy from saw logs, veener logs, stumps and roots and avoid promoting the use of quality roundwood for energy except in well-defined circumstances.

Where no other use for woody biomass is economically viable or environmentally appropriate, energy recovery helps to reduce energy generation from non-renewable sources. Member States’ support schemes for bioenergy should therefore be directed to such feedstocks for which little market competition exists with the material sectors, and whose sourcing is considered positive for both climate and biodiversity, in order to avoid negative incentives for unsustainable bioenergy pathways, as identified in the JRC report ‘The use of woody biomass for energy production in the EU’</span><span class="FootnoteReference">

Moreover, in order to ensure a more efficient use of bioenergy, from 2026 on Member States should not give support anymore to electricity-only plants , unless the installations are in regions with a specific use status as regards their transition away from fossil fuels or if the installations use carbon capture and storage. </span>

Renewable electricity can also be used to produce synthetic fuels for consumption in hard-to-decarbonise transport sectors such as aviation and maritime transport. A framework for electrification needs to enable robust and efficient coordination and expand market mechanisms to match both supply and demand in space and time, stimulate investments in flexibility, and help integrate large shares of variable renewable generation. Member States should therefore ensure that the deployment of renewable electricity continues to increase at an adequate pace to meet growing demand. For this, Member States should establish a framework that includes market-compatible mechanisms to tackle remaining barriers to have secure and adequate electricity systems fit for a high level of renewable energy, as well as storage facilities, fully integrated into the electricity system.

Member States should therefore jointly define the amount of offshore renewable generation to be deployed within each sea basin by 2050, with intermediate steps in 2030 and 2040. These objectives should be reflected in the updated national energy and climate plans that will be submitted in 2023 and 2024 pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/1999. In defining the amount, Member States should take into account the offshore renewable energy potential of each sea basin, environmental protection, climate adaptation and other uses of the sea, as well as the Union’s decarbonisation targets. In addition, Member States should increasingly consider the possibility of combining offshore renewable energy generation with transmission lines interconnecting several Member States, in the form of hybrid projects or, at a later stage, a more meshed grid.
