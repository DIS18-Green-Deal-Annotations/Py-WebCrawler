               <span>A well-functioning and competitive aviation internal market is essential for the mobility of European citizens and for the European economy as a whole. In 2018, the aviation and aeronautical industries employed an estimated 0.4 million people directly in the EU</span><span class="FootnoteReference">

                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref4" href="#footnote4">3</a>
               </span><span>, over 1.2 billion passengers flew to and from more than 500 airports in Europe. The EU aviation sector contributes to European integration and reinforces the EU’s position as a geopolitical leader.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span> Air connectivity is an essential driver of mobility for EU citizens, of development for EU regions and of growth for the economy as a whole. High levels of air connectivity within the EU, as well as to and from the EU, are best ensured when the EU air transport market functions as a level playing field, where all market actors can operate based on equal opportunities. When occurring, market distortions risk putting aircraft operators or airports at disadvantage towards competitors. In turn, this can result in a loss of competitiveness of the industry, and a loss of air connectivity for citizens and businesses.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>In particular, it is essential to ensure a level playing field across the EU air transport market, when it comes to the use of aviation fuel. Indeed, aviation fuel accounts for a substantial share of aircraft operators’ costs, i.e. up to 25% of operational costs. Variations in the price of aviation fuel can have important impacts on aircraft operators’ economic performance. Furthermore, differences in the price of aviation fuel between geographic locations, as is currently the case between EU airports or between EU and non-EU airports, can lead aircraft operators to adapt their refuelling strategies for economic reasons.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Practices such as ‘fuel tankering’ occur when aircraft operators uplift more aviation fuel than necessary at a given airport, with the aim to avoid refuelling partially or fully at a destination airport where aviation fuel is more expensive. Fuel tankering leads to higher fuel burn than necessary, hence higher emissions, and undermines fair competition in the Union air transport market. Besides being contrary to the Union’s efforts to decarbonise aviation, fuel tankering is also detrimental to healthy competition between aviation market players. With the introduction and the ramp-up of sustainable aviation fuels at Union airports, practices of fuel tankering may be exacerbated as a result of increased aviation fuel costs. In respect to fuel tankering, the present Regulation therefore aims restore and preserve a level playing field in the air transport sector, while at the same time avoiding any adverse environmental effect. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The Commission adopted in December 2020 the Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref5" href="#footnote5">4</a>
               </span><span>. This strategy sets out the objective to boost the uptake of sustainable aviation fuels</span><span>. </span><span>Sustainable aviation fuels have the potential to deliver a major contribution to achieving the increased EU climate target for 2030 and the EU’s climate neutrality objective. For the purpose of this initiative, sustainable aviation fuels means liquid drop-in fuels substitutable to conventional aviation fuel. In order to decrease significantly its emissions, the aviation sector needs to reduce its current exclusive reliance on fossil jet fuel and accelerate its transition to innovative and sustainable types of fuels and technologies. While alternative propulsion technologies for aircraft such as powered by electricity or hydrogen are making promising advances, their introduction to commercial use will take a considerable effort and time to prepare. Because air transport needs to address its carbon footprint on all flight ranges already by 2030, the role of</span><span> </span><span>sustainable aviation liquid fuels will be essential. For this reason, measures are also needed to increase the supply and use of sustainable aviation fuels at Union airports. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>While several sustainable aviation fuels pathways are certified to be used in aviation, their use is currently negligible, for lack of production at affordable cost. A blending mandate specifically targeting the aviation sector is necessary, in order to spur the market uptake of the most innovative and sustainable fuel technologies. This would allow to scale up production capacity and lower production costs over time. Given that sustainable aviation fuels should account for at least 5% of aviation fuels by 2030 and 63% by 2050, it is essential that the fuel technologies supported under this Regulation have the highest potential in terms of innovation, decarbonisation and availability. This is a sine qua non condition in order to meet future aviation demand and contribute to achieving the decarbonisation objectives. This should cover notably advanced biofuels and synthetic aviation fuels. In particular, synthetic aviation fuels have the potential to achieve emission savings as high as 85% or more compared to fossil aviation fuel. When produced from renewable electricity and carbon captured directly from the air, the potential emission savings compared to fossil aviation fuel can reach 100%. As such, synthetic aviation fuels have the highest potential for decarbonisation of all fuels considered under this initiative. Their production process is also particularly resource efficient, notably as regards the use of water, compared to the production of other sustainable aviation fuels pathways. While synthetic aviation fuels could contribute significantly to decarbonise the sector, its emergence on the market in sizeable volumes by 2030 is unlikely in the absence of dedicated policy support. Indeed, the production costs of synthetic aviation fuels are currently estimated at 3 to 6 times the current market price of fossil aviation fuel. As synthetic aviation fuels are expected to play a role in the decarbonisation of the sector already by 2030, and should contribute to at least 28% of the aviation fuel mix by 2050, it is therefore necessary for this Regulation to set out dedicated sub-obligation, pushing their introduction on the market. This is expected to partly de-risk investments in synthetic aviation fuels production capacity and allow the production capacity to scale-up.</span>

            <p class="Normal">
               <span class="normaltextrun">For sustainability reasons, first generation biofuels such as crop-based biofuels ￼Feed￼, and food and crop-based biofuels, which have limited scalability potential and raise sustainability concerns, should not be supported. Indirect land-use change occurs when the cultivation of crops for biofuels displaces traditional production of crops for food and feed purposes. Such additional demand increases the pressure on land and can lead to the extension of agricultural land into areas with high-carbon stock, such as forests, wetlands and peatland, causing additional greenhouse gas emissions. Research has shown that the scale of the effect depends on a variety of factors, including the type of feedstock used for fuel production, the level of additional demand for feedstock triggered by the use of biofuels and the extent to which land with high-carbon stock is protected worldwide. The highest risks of indirect land-use change have been identified for biofuels produced from feedstock for which a significant expansion of the production area into land with high-carbon stock is observed. In addition to the greenhouse gas emissions linked to indirect land-use change – which is capable of negating some or all greenhouse gas emissions savings of individual biofuels, indirect land-use change poses risks also to biodiversity. This risk is particularly serious in connection with a potentially large expansion of production determined by a significant increase in demand. Accordingly, feed and food crop-based fuels should not be promoted. This approach is in line with the relevant Union policy framework, which tends to limit or even phase out the use of crop-based biofuels, for environmental reasons. This is notably the case in the Renewable Energy Directive, which caps the use of crop-based biofuels because of their limited environmental benefits, limited greenhouse gas savings potential, and the fact that such biofuels are in direct competition with the food and feed sectors for access to feedstock. The non-inclusion of crop-based biofuels should also aim to avoid the risk biofuel displacement from the road sector towards air transport, as this could slow down the decarbonisation of road transport, which currently remains by far the most polluting transport mode. The aviation sector has currently insignificant levels of demand for food and feed crops-based biofuels, since over 99% of currently used aviation fuels are of fossil origin. It is therefore appropriate to avoid the creation of a potentially large demand of food and feed crops-based biofuels by promoting their use under this Regulation. </span>

               <span>Technologies that are the most industrially mature and at the same time present high levels of sustainability potential, such as sustainable aviation fuels produced from waste lipids (feedstock listed in Annex IX Part B of RED II), should be eligible in order to launch the market and allow for emissions reductions already in the short term.</span><span> </span><span>Whereas such a measure is expected to reduce substantially emissions from the transport sector as a whole, at present, the large majority of liquid biofuels are produced for the road sector. Therefore, a shift of feedstock for production of biofuels in the road sector to production for the aviation sector may occur</span><span>, </span><span>but would be limited</span><span>.</span><span> Indeed, it estimate that the potential displacement for biofuels produced from Annex IX Part B of RED II would be around 3.2% by 2030 </span><span class="FootnoteReference">

            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The gradual introduction of sustainable aviation fuels on the air transport market is expected to result in increased aviation fuel costs for airlines. This may accentuate pre-existing distortive practices by aircraft operators, such as fuel tankering. The present proposal for a Regulation therefore aims to gear the EU aviation market with robust rules to ensure that gradually increasing shares of sustainable aviation fuels can be introduced at EU airports without detrimental effects on the competitiveness of the EU aviation internal market.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>An essential factor to ensure that the obligation to supply sustainable aviation fuels does not harm the level playing field of the air transport market, is to impose a clear and uniform obligation for all aviation fuel suppliers on the EU internal market. Due to the inherent cross-border and global dimension of air transport, a harmonised aviation-specific Regulation is preferred, over a framework requiring transposition at national level, as the latter could result in a patchwork of national measures with differing requirements and targets. For a clear and effective policy design, obligations on aviation fuel suppliers as regards sustainable aviation fuels should be set out exclusively in this Regulation, which constitutes a lex specialis of the Renewable Energy Directive. As the Regulation sets minimum shares of sustainable aviation fuel, it does not prevent airlines or fuel suppliers from pursuing more ambitious environmental objectives or seeking other economic/financial advantages related to SAF through uplifting or supplying higher shares of sustainable aviation fuels. To this end, airlines should be able to seek to ensure adequate arrangements with aviation fuel suppliers to increase their uptake of sustainable aviation fuels. The Regulation does not include tradability of sustainable aviation fuel use (so-called ‘book and claim’ system). If trading were introduced at any point in the future, it should be governed by robust rules ensuring the environmental integrity of the system.</span>

            <p class="Normal">
               <span class="CommentReference">This Regulation should be accompanied with intensified efforts of the EU and its Member States at ICAO to establish binding targets for the use of sustainable aviation fuels in international aviation, with an EU strategic alliance to strengthen value chain of sustainable aviation fuels production in the EU notably for the most innovative technologies such as advanced biofuels and synthetic aviation fuels, including notably funding mechanisms such as contracts for differences and measures to facilitate the certification of innovative sustainable aviation fuels technologies.</span>

               <span>The present proposal for a Regulation is consistent with the EU’s air transport policy, and in particular with the relevant rules forming the framework of the EU aviation internal market. It pursues the same objectives as Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 September 2008 on common rules for the operation of air services in the Community, namely to ensure that airlines operating in the EU can compete on the basis of equal opportunity. The proposed Regulation is also in line with Regulation (EU) 2019/712 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 April 2019 on safeguarding competition in air transport, which aims to ensure that all air carriers operating to and from the EU can benefit of a level playing field. </span>

The proposed Regulation requires EASA to receive and process reports from airlines, notably on their aviation fuel uplifts.

The proposed Regulation relies on components of the RED II rules, notably its sustainability framework. RED II is a cross-sector framework that sets targets for overarching sectors. It has been insufficient to boost the uptake of sustainable aviation fuels due to the specificities of the aviation sector, in particular the strong EU-wide and global competitive cost pressure of the sector, as well as the highly integrated and competitive EU aviation internal market and its global dimension. The proposed Regulation lays down fully harmonised requirements to ensure a level playing field between airlines and the avoidance of competitive disadvantage between EU airports. </span>

               <span>EU-level action on SAF would contribute to achieving the increased EU’s climate ambition as set out in the European Climate Law. The 2030 Climate Target Plan establishes that SAF have a major role to play to reduce emissions from aviation by 2030 and 2050 and attain EU climate goals. Therefore, establishing EU rules on SAF production and use allows taking a “tailored” approach towards meeting the targets. Relying on national measures only with likely different targets (if any) would incur the risk that the aggregated level of ambition is not sufficient. The current initiative can also support the forthcoming review of the Renewable Energy Directive by reinforcing the share of renewable energy in the transport sector.</span>

            <p class="Normal">
               <span>EU-level action may have positive effects at international level. As EU intervention would have effects on the entire aviation and SAF EU market, it is expected to have higher prominence towards third countries than isolated national initiatives. Spill-over effects are also likely to occur more easily, whereby third countries may consider adopting similar measures. In turn, this could accelerate the ongoing work at ICAO level on the use of SAF. In short, EU action could spur further developments on the production and uptake of SAF outside of the EU, which could help create a level playing field at global level, as well as reduce air transport emissions at a wider scope.</span>

                  <span>The present initiative must be rolled out swiftly and efficiently, as a key deliverable of the European Green Deal and the Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy, and as a necessary building block towards reaching EU’s climate goals by 2030 and 2050 by ensuring that the aviation sectors speed up its own decarbonisation without jeopardising the well-demonstrated benefits of a highly integrated aviation internal market. As explained in section 1.4 and Annex 11, this can be achieved most successfully by directly regulating economic actors at EU level through an internal market Regulation. Indeed, common rules applying directly and uniformly to aviation and fuel market actors across the EU will provide clarity and uniformity. As the aviation single market is inherently integrated at EU level, it functions best when rules are applied to all airlines in the same way. Imposing the same requirements to all market players reduces the risks of distortion of competition and sends clear signals to non-EU aviation market actors, when flying in the EU. A uniform set of rules across the EU, as established under a Regulation, will allow to send loud and clear signals to the market. As the transition to SAF requires significant investments, it is indispensable that the regulatory framework provides a single, long-term and robust set of rules to all investors EU-wide. In particular, it is crucial to avoid the creation of a patchwork of differing measures at national level, as would be the case if implemented under a cross-sectoral directive. While this can function with transport modes like road or rail, it cannot be successful for transport modes that are so cross-border and global as aviation. The market scale of most airlines is EU-wide or even global. A patchwork of national transpositions could reduce the effectiveness of the policy and put in jeopardy the effective decarbonisation of air transport. It could also be conducive to different economic behaviours in the aviation and fuel industries from one Member State to another. This could lead to practices of cost avoidance (e.g. via fuel tankering) that would undermine the functioning of the Single Market. The present initiative will have an important impact on air transport actors and the aviation internal market as a whole. It is essential that obligations set on all airlines apply to all airlines uniformly, as can be ensured via a regulation. It is equally important for the effectiveness of this initiative that the fuel supply obligation be implemented and enforced in a uniform way. Differing fuel supply obligations in different areas of the EU (e.g. different targets, varying sustainability standards, etc.) would set differences of treatments between airlines and could induce competitive distortions between EU airports or put EU aviation actors at disadvantage with non-EU competitors. The present initiative should be implemented in a standalone regulation in order to cater for the specificities and complexities of the aviation single market.</span>

                  <span>This proposal for a Regulation follows a comprehensive consultation that took place over the course of 2020. The Commission carried out a public consultation in March and April 2020 on the inception impact assessment. A total of 121 feedback were received from public authorities, aeronautics and fuels industries, not-for-profit organisations, academics and citizens. In general, the feedback expressed support for EU-level regulatory action to boost the uptake of sustainable aviation fuels. The Commission organised two roundtables (in March and November 2020), each time with sessions dedicated to discussions with stakeholders and Member States, and sessions dedicated to discussions with Member States only. The roundtables allowed to get direct views and exchange with the participants on the need for regulatory action at EU level on sustainable aviation fuels. The first roundtable allowed to gain valuable insights on the problem definition, while the second roundtable focused on the policy options, enabling participants to give their views on their preferred option, and suggesting adjustments in the design of the proposed options. An open public consultation of 12 weeks ran from August to October 2020. A total of 156 replies were collected from public authorities, aeronautics and fuels industries, non-governmental organisations, academics and citizens. In general, the replies expressed support for EU-level regulatory action to boost the uptake of sustainable aviation fuels in the form of a SAF blending mandate. Valuable information was collected on the preference of respondents towards specific designs of this measure. Finally, in the course of the supporting study performed by an external contractor, a targeted consultation was performed, to obtain specific and detailed insights on the functioning of the aviation market, the state of the aviation fuels market, the production of sustainable aviation fuels and the various existing or upcoming policies supporting the use of sustainable aviation fuels. This targeted consultation focused on actors of the aeronautics industry, the aviation fuels industry, Member States, not-for-profit organisations and international aviation organisations.</span>

               <span>Throughout this comprehensive consultation strategy, the large majority of stakeholders of the aviation (airlines, airports, aircraft manufacturers) and fuel industries, Member States and NGOs supported establishing a SAF obligation as an effective policy mechanism to boost SAF production and uptake and successfully decarbonise the aviation sector. Stakeholders were quite divided on the specific design of the option but a majority of fuel suppliers, Member States, NGOs, airports and part of the airlines support a supply-side SAF obligation with flexibility in the fuel distribution, and covering jet fuel supplied for all flights departing from EU airports. At the same time, the majority of stakeholders saw the need for measures preventing carbon leakage and distortion in the aviation internal market. A majority of stakeholders (airlines, airports, fuel industry, NGOs, Member States) also support specific incentives to support RFNBOs. All these measures were included in the preferred policy option.</span>

                  <span>The policy options proposed were structured around a regulatory requirement consisting of a SAF obligation. This requirement allows for restoring a level playing field in the air transport sector as regards the uplift of aviation fuel and keeping it while increasing the use of SAF in aviation. Policy options provided different ways to design the obligation. A first set of Options included an obligation on fuel suppliers to distribute SAF at all EU airports. A second set of options included an obligation on airlines to uptake SAF when flying from EU airports (one sub-option covered all flights, the other sub-option covered intra-EU flights only). Finally, a third set of options included obligations on the fuel suppliers to distribute SAF with some flexibility at the start, and on airlines to uptake jet fuel before departing from EU airports. Targets were designed in SAF volume terms for options, and in jet fuel CO2 intensity reduction terms for the others. All options contained incentives to support renewable fuels of non-biological origin (RFNBOs). The preferred option was to impose a SAF blending mandate on the fuel suppliers and a jet fuel uplift obligation on airlines, including a sub-mandate on RFNBOs. This option was preferred as it allows to ensure a level playing field in the air transport market while scaling up significantly SAF production and uptake. </span>

               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>The preferred policy options allows to maintain the competitiveness of the air transport industry and leads to a significant reduction of well-to-wing CO2 emissions in the aviation sector, i.e. by around 60-61% by 2050, compared to the baseline scenario. Air pollutant emissions decrease by around 9% by 2050 relative to the baseline. Overall, environmental costs of aviation (related to CO2 emissions and air pollutants emissions) are reduced by around €87-88 billion compared to the baseline, expressed as present value over 2021-2050 period. SAF production capacity increases by an additional 25.5-25.6Mt by 2050. SAF emergence on the market leads to a large reduction of aviation’s reliance on fossil jet fuel, which consumption reduces by 65% by 2050 compared to the baseline. The energy security of the EU improves as imports of fossil energy from third countries decrease and feedstock and renewable electricity for SAF production are sourced in the EU (EU-produced SAF represents 92% of total SAF use in 2050). Under the preferred policy options, SAF technologies with the highest decarbonisation potential emerge on the market in significant quantities earlier than without policy action. SAF prices decrease compared to current estimates, which contributes to reducing the price gap with fossil jet fuel over time. The preferred policy options lead to net job creation in the EU, i.e. around 202,100 additional jobs compared to the baseline. Finally, the reduction in air pollution has positive effects on public health (i.e. external costs from air pollution decrease by about €1.5 billion over the period 2021 to 2050, compared to the baseline). </span>

               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>Overall POs C1 and C2 lead to an increase of the costs of €20.3 billion (C1) and €14.6 billion (C2) relative to the baseline over the period 2021 to 2050. These costs are largely driven by an increase in jet fuel cost relative to the baseline, i.e. €103.5 billion (C1) and €88.2 billion (C2), expressed as present value over 2021-2050. The increase in fuel costs is reflected on air fares, which are estimated to increase by around 8.1-8.2% by 2050. Higher air fares lead to a slight reduction in total passenger air transport activity relative to the baseline, despite still growing by 77% by 2050 relative to 2015. This triggers lower capital and operational costs for air transport relative to the baseline, i.e. by €84 billion (C1) and €74.5 billion (C2). Additional logistics costs amount to €0.19 billion (C1 and C2). Airlines also incur an increase in reporting costs of €0.34 billion (C1 and C2) relative to the baseline, expressed as present value over 2021-2050. For the SAF producers, the investment needs over the period 2021 to 2050 are estimated at around €10.4-10.5 billion. Indeed, 104 to 106 additional SAF plants need to be built in the EU by 2050 to cater for the necessary SAF production capacity. </span>

Variations in fuel prices can affect significantly aircraft operators’ economic performance and negatively impact competition on the market. Where differences in aviation fuel prices exist between Union airports or between Union and non-Union airports, this can lead aircraft operators to adapt their refuelling strategies for economic reasons. Fuel tankering increases aircraft’s fuel consumption and results in unnecessary greenhouse gas emissions.  Fuel tankering by aircraft operators accordingly undermines of the Union’s efforts towards environmental protection. Some aircraft operators are able to use favourable aviation fuel prices at their home base as a competitive advantage towards other airlines operating similar routes. This can have detrimental effects on the competitiveness of the sector and  be harmful to air connectivity.

               <span>Sustainable aviation fuels are liquid, drop-in fuels, fully fungible with conventional aviation fuel and compatible with existing aircraft engines.  Several production pathways of sustainable aviation fuels have been certified at global level for use in civil or military aviation. Sustainable aviation fuels are technologically ready to play an important role in reducing emissions from air transport already in the very short term. They are expected to account for a major part of the aviation fuel mix in the medium and long term. </span><span>Further, with the support of appropriate international fuel standards, sustainable aviation fuels might contribute to lowering the aromatic content of the final fuel used by an operator, thus helping to reduce other non-CO</span><span>2</span><span> emissions. </span><span>Other alternatives to power aircraft, such as electricity or liquid hydrogen are expected to progressively contribute to the decarbonisation of air transport, beginning with short-haul flights.</span>

This regulation should take measures to prevent that the introduction of sustainable aviation fuels affects negatively the competitiveness of the aviation sector by defining harmonised requirements across the Union. </span>

While incentives are set in CORSIA and sustainable aviation fuels are considered an integral pillar of the work on the feasibility of a Long-Term Aspiration Goal for international aviation, there is currently no mandatory scheme on the use of sustainable aviation fuels for international flights. Comprehensive multilateral or bilateral air transport agreements between the EU or its Member States, and third countries generally include provisions on environmental protection.

In the past, such horizontal cross-sectoral regulatory frameworks have not proven effective to operate a transition from fossil fuels to sustainable aviation fuel in air transport. Directive (EU) 2018/2001 and its predecessor set out overarching targets across all transport modes to be supplied with renewable fuels. As aviation is a small fuels market for which renewable fuels are more costly to produce while a fully integrated European transport market, in comparison to other transport modes, such regulatory frameworks</span><span> </span><span>should be complemented with aviation-specific measures to effectively boost the deployment of sustainable aviation fuels</span><span>. Further, national transpositions of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 risks creating significant fragmentation in the air transport market, where national rules on sustainable aviation fuels would set out widely differing targets. This would be expected to further exacerbate the issues of level playing field in air transport. </span>

It should not apply to aircraft such as military aircraft and aircraft engaged in operations for humanitarian, search, rescue, disaster relief or medical purposes, as well as customs, police and fire-fighting operations. Indeed, flights operated in such circumstances are of exceptional nature and as such cannot always be planned in the same way as regular flights. Due to the nature of their operations, they may not always be in a position to fulfil obligations under this Regulation, as it may represent unnecessary burden. In order to cater for a level playing field across the EU aviation single market, this regulation should cover the largest possible share of commercial air traffic operated from airports located on EU territory. At the same time, in order to safeguard air connectivity for the benefits of EU citizens, businesses and regions, it is important to avoid imposing undue burden on air transport operations at small airports. A threshold of yearly passenger air traffic and freight traffic should be defined, below which airports would not be covered by this Regulation; however, the scope of the Regulation should cover at least 95% of total traffic departing from airports in the Union. For the same reasons, a threshold should be defined to exempt aircraft operators accountable for a very low number of departures from airports located on EU territory.</span>

               <span class="num"><span>(16)</span></span><span>Development and deployment of sustainable aviation fuels with a high potential for sustainability, commercial maturity and a high potential for innovation and growth to meet future needs should be promoted. This should support creating innovative and competitive fuels markets and ensure sufficient supply of sustainable aviation fuels for aviation in short and long term to contribute to Union transport decarbonisation ambitions, while strengthening Union’s efforts towards a high level of environmental protection. For this purpose, sustainable aviation fuels produced from feedstock listed in Parts A and B of Annex IX of Directive (EU) 2018/2001, as well as synthetic aviation fuels should be eligible. In particular, sustainable aviation fuels produced from feedstock listed in Part B of Annex IX of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 are essential, as currently the most commercially mature technology to decarbonise air transport already in the short term. </span>

            <p class="li ManualConsidrant">
               <span class="num"><span>(17)</span></span><span>For sustainability reasons, feed and food crop-based fuels should not be eligible. In particular, indirect land-use change occurs when the cultivation of crops for biofuels displaces traditional production of crops for food and feed purposes. Such additional demand increases the pressure on land and can lead to the extension of agricultural land into areas with high-carbon stock, such as forests, wetlands and peatland, causing additional greenhouse gas emissions and loss of biodiversity concerns. Research has shown that the scale of the effect depends on a variety of factors, including the type of feedstock used for fuel production, the level of additional demand for feedstock triggered by the use of biofuels and the extent to which land with high-carbon stock is protected worldwide. The highest risks of indirect land-use change have been identified for biofuels, fuels produced from feedstock for which a significant expansion of the production area into land with high-carbon stock is observed. Accordingly, feed and food crop-based fuels should not be promoted. This approach is in line Union policy and in particular with Directive (EU) 2018/2001 which limits and sets a cap on the use of such biofuels in road and rail transport, considering their lower environmental benefits, lower performance in terms of greenhouse reduction potential and broader sustainability concerns. In addition to the greenhouse gas emissions linked to indirect land-use change – which is capable of negating some or all greenhouse gas emissions savings of individual biofuels – indirect land-use change poses risks also to biodiversity. This risk is particularly serious in connection with a potentially large expansion of production determined by a significant increase in demand. The aviation sector has currently insignificant levels of demand for food and feed crops-based biofuels, since over 99% of currently used aviation fuels are of fossil origin. It is therefore appropriate to avoid the creation of a potentially large demand of food and feed crops-based biofuels by promoting their use under this Regulation. The non-eligibility of crop-based biofuels under this Regulation also minimises any risk to slow down the decarbonisation of road transport, which could otherwise result from a shift of crop-based biofuels from the road to the aviation sector. It is essential to minimise such a shift, as road transport currently remains by far the most polluting transport sector. </span>

               <span class="num"><span>(19)</span></span><span>The present Regulation should aim to ensure that aircraft operators can compete on the basis of equal opportunities as regards the access to sustainable aviation fuels. To avoid any distortions on the air services market, all Union airports covered by this Regulation should be supplied with uniform minimum shares of sustainable aviation fuels. Whereas the market is free to supply and use larger quantities of sustainable fuel, this Regulation should ensure that the mandatory minimum shares of sustainable aviation fuels are the same across all the covered airports. It supersedes any requirements established directly or indirectly at national or regional level requiring aircraft operators or aviation fuel suppliers to uptake or supply sustainable aviation fuels with different targets than the ones prescribed under this Regulation. In order to create a clear and predictable legal framework and in doing so encourage the market development and deployment of the most sustainable and innovative with growth potential to meet future needs fuel technologies, this Regulation should set out gradually increasing minimum shares of synthetic aviation fuels over time. Setting out a dedicated sub-obligation on synthetic aviation fuels is necessary in view of the significant decarbonisation potential of such fuels, and in view of their current estimated production costs. When produced from renewable electricity and carbon captured directly from the air, synthetic aviation fuels can achieve as high as 100% emissions savings compared to conventional aviation fuel. They also have notable advantages compared to other types of sustainable aviation fuels with regards to resource efficiency (in particular for water needs) of the production process. However, synthetic aviation fuels’ production costs are currently estimated at 3 to 6 times higher than the market price of conventional aviation fuel. Therefore, this Regulation should establish a dedicated sub-obligation for this technology. Other types of synthetic fuels, such as low carbon synthetic fuels achieving high greenhouse gas reductions, could be considered for inclusion in the scope of this Regulation in the course of future revisions, where such fuels become defined under the Renewable Energy Directive.</span>

Similarly, in order to provide legal certainty and predictability to the market and drive investments durably towards sustainable aviation fuels production capacity, the terms of this Regulation should be stable over a long period of time.</span>

               <span class="num"><span>(21)</span></span><span>With the introduction and ramp-up of sustainable aviation fuels at Union airports, practices of fuel tankering may be exacerbated as a consequence of aviation fuel costs increases. Tankering practices are unstainable and should be avoided as they undermine the Union’s efforts to reduce environmental impacts from transport. Those would be contrary to the aviation decarbonisation objectives as increased aircraft weight would increase fuel consumption and related emissions on a given flight. Tankering practices also put at risk the level playing field in the Union between aircraft operators, and also between airports. This Regulation should therefore require aircraft operators to refuel prior to departure from a given Union airport. The amount of fuel uplifted prior to departures from a given Union airport should be commensurate with the amount of fuel necessary to operate the flights departing from that airport, taking into account the necessary compliance with fuel safety rules. The requirement ensures that equal conditions for operations in the Union applying equally to Union and foreign operators, while ensuring high level of environmental protection. As the Regulation does not define a maximum share of sustainable aviation fuels in all aviation fuels, airlines and fuel suppliers may pursue more ambitious environmental policies with higher sustainable aviation fuels uptake and supply in their overall network of operations, while avoiding fuel tankering.</span>
