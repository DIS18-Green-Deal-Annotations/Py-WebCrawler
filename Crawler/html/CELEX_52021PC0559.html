               <span>Mobility and transport are essential for everyone living in Europe and for the European economy as a whole. Free movement of people and goods across the internal borders of the European Union is a fundamental freedom of the EU and its single market. Mobility brings many socio‑economic benefits to the European public and businesses, but also has a growing impact on the environment, including in the form of increased greenhouse gas emissions and local air pollution, which affect human health and well-being.</span>
            </p>

The aim is for the EU to become a climate-neutral economy by 2050, while also working towards a zero-pollution ambition. In September 2020, the Commission adopted its proposal for a European Climate Law to reduce net emissions of greenhouse gases by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 and to put Europe on a responsible path to becoming climate-neutral by 2050</span><span class="FootnoteReference">

On 21 April 2021, the Council and Parliament reached provisional political agreement on the European Climate Law.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="BodyText">
               <span>In December 2020, the Commission adopted the </span><span>Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy</span><span> communication</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref5" href="#footnote5">5</a>
               </span><span>). The strategy lays the foundation for how the EU transport system can achieve this transformation and sets concrete milestones to keep the transport system’s journey towards a smart and sustainable future on track. The transport sector is still vastly reliant on fossil fuels. Boosting the uptake of zero- and low-emission vehicles, vessels and aeroplanes and of renewable and low-carbon fuels in all modes of transport is a priority objective in the quest to make all transport modes more</span><span> </span><span>sustainable.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="BodyText">
               <span>The increased deployment and use of renewable and low-carbon fuels must go hand in hand with the creation of a comprehensive network of recharging and refuelling infrastructure based on a geographically fair manner to enable the widespread uptake of low- and zero-emission vehicles in all transport modes. In the passenger car markets particularly, the broad mass of consumers will only switch to zero- emission vehicles once they are sure they can recharge or refuel their vehicles anywhere in the EU and as easily as is currently the case for conventionally fuelled vehicles. It is important that no EU region or territory is left behind and that regional disparities in the deployment of the infrastructure for alternative fuels are well-addressed in the formulation and implementation of national policy frameworks.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="BodyText">
               <span>Directive 2014/94/EU on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure (‘the Directive’) </span><span>sets out a framework of common measures for the deployment of such infrastructure in the EU. It requires Member States to set up national policy frameworks to establish markets for alternative fuels and ensure that an appropriate number of publicly accessible recharging and  refuelling points is put in place, particularly also to enable free cross-border circulation of such vehicles and vessels on the TEN-T network. In its recent report on the application of Directive 2014/94/EU on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure, the Commission noted some progress in the Directive’s implementation</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref6" href="#footnote6">6</a>
               </span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>However, the shortcomings of the current policy framework are also clearly visible: as there is no detailed and binding methodology for Member States to calculate targets and adopt measures, their level of ambition in target setting and supporting policies in place varies greatly. A comprehensive and complete network of alternative fuels infrastructure does not exist across the EU, the report concludes. Likewise, the European Court of Auditors noted in its special report on recharging infrastructure that obstacles to travelling across the EU in electric vehicles remain and that the deployment of recharging infrastructure in the Union needs to accelerate</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref7" href="#footnote7">7</a>

            <p class="BodyText">
               <span>The Commission carried out an </span><span>ex post</span><span> evaluation of this Directive</span><span class="FootnoteReference">

               </span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>The evaluation found that the Directive is not well-adapted to the purpose of serving the increased climate ambition for 2030. The main problems include that Member States’ infrastructure planning on average lacks the level of ambition, consistency and coherence needed, leading to insufficient, unevenly distributed infrastructure. Further interoperability issues with physical connections persist, while new issues have emerged over communication standards, including data exchange among the different actors in the electro-mobility ecosystem. Finally, there is a lack of transparent consumer information and common payment systems, which limits user acceptance. Without further EU action, this lack of interoperable, easy-to use recharging and refuelling infrastructure is likely to become a barrier to the needed market growth of low- and zero-emission vehicles, vessels and – in the future – aircraft.</span>

            <p class="BodyText">
               <span>This proposal is part of the overall set of interlinked policy initiatives under the ‘Fit for 55’ package. These policy initiatives correspond to the actions needed across all sectors of the economy to complement national efforts to achieve the increased climate ambition for 2030, as described in the Commission’s 2021 work programme</span><span class="FootnoteReference">

            <p class="BodyText">
               <span>This initiative seeks to ensure the availability and usability of a dense, widespread network of alternative fuels infrastructure throughout the EU. All users of alternative fuel vehicles (including vessels and aircraft) need to be able to move through the EU at ease, enabled by key infrastructure such as motorways, ports and airports. The specific objectives are: (i) ensuring minimum infrastructure to support the required uptake of alternative fuel vehicles across all transport modes and in all Member States to meet the EU’s climate objectives; (ii) ensuring the infrastructure’s full interoperability; and (iii) ensuring full user information and adequate payment options.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="BodyText">
               <span>Meeting the European Green Deal goal on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from transport and developing a common EU transport market require full connectivity and a seamless user experience along the European transport network for low- and zero-emission vehicles, vessels and aircraft. This in turn requires sufficient quantity and full interoperability of infrastructure across borders. Only a common European legislative framework can reach these objectives. This initiative will contribute to coherent and consistent development and rollout of vehicle fleets, recharging and refuelling infrastructure and user information and services.</span>

            <p class="Normal">
               <span>For waterborne transport, this initiative delivers on the clear requirement of the European Green Deal to oblige docked ships to use shore-side electricity. It is fully complementary to Fuel EU maritime initiative by ensuring that sufficient shore-side electricity supply is installed in ports to provide electricity while passenger ships (including ro-ro passenger ships, high speed passenger craft and cruise ships) and container vessels are at berth and accommodating the demand for decarbonised gases (i.e. bio-LNG and synthetic gaseous fuels (e-gas). For the case of passenger ships, the different ship categories vary in their power demand characteristics while at berth, which leads to different investment needs at port. This needs to be combined with the different operational characteristics of ports, including layouts and terminals. For this reason a further distinction is made on passenger ships compared to the FuelEU maritime initiative in identifying two categories, that of ro-ro passenger ships and high speed passenger vessels, and that of other passenger ships, notably cruise ships. Together with the FuelEU maritime initiative it therefore contributes to overcoming the current “chicken-and-egg” issue, which has meant that the very low demand for ship operators to connect to the electric grid while at berth has made it less attractive for ports to invest in short-side electricity. Limited introduction of On-shore power supply OPS in ports risks disturbing the level playing between ports, in particular for early investors, as not OPS equipped vessels could shift their traffic. It is therefore important that minimum requirements be set for maritime ports across the whole TEN-T network. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The initiative is also complementary to the ReFuelEU aviation initiative. It supplements that initiative’s push for sustainable aviation fuels that largely do not require a distinct refuelling infrastructure with provisions for electricity supply for all stationary aircraft and thus supporting the decarbonisation of the aviation sector.</span>

               <span>Next to the legislative proposal, the Commission will address the need for additional research and innovation (R&amp;I) activities, in particular through the co-programmed Zero Emissions Waterborne Transport partnership proposed by the Waterborne Technology Platform under Horizon Europe, the Clan Sky 2 Joint Undertaking and the Clean Hydrogen Joint Undertaking which works in synergy with these two transport partnerships.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="BodyText">
               <span> This initiative is also consistent with the revision of the Renewable Energy Directive. It seeks to ensure that lack of recharging and refuelling infrastructure does not hamper the overall ramp-up of renewable and low-carbon fuels in the transport sector, where they require distinct infrastructure. At Union level, there is no policy instrument equivalent to the Directive on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure able to ensure deployment of publicly accessible recharging and refuelling infrastructure across all modes of transport in a similar manner. This initiative is also closely linked to the upcoming proposal to revise the Regulation on the Guidelines for the Trans-European Transport Network</span><span class="FootnoteReference">

With this legal framework in mind, Union action enables better coordination for the even and widespread deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure, instead of relying on Member States only. This facilitates travel across the Union in alternative fuel vehicles for both personal users and businesses.

Such a framework has supported the development of national policies to develop alternative fuels infrastructure in all Member States and has supported the creation of a more level playing field within the industry. By encouraging interoperability, relevant technical standards and setting of targets on similar timescales, Union-level action has provided some cost savings and better value for money by facilitating economies of scale, avoiding duplication of effort and resources, and providing funding investments for infrastructure.

            <p class="BodyText">
               <span>While the Impact Assessment resulted in a Directive as the preferred policy option, the Commission made the choice to propose a Regulation. The choice of a Regulation ensures a rapid and coherent development towards a dense, widely-spread network of fully interoperable recharging infrastructure in all Member States. The decision is particularly justified in view of the needed swift and coherent implementation of the national fleet-based minimum deployment targets set at Member State level and the mandatory distance-based targets along the TEN-T network, as the first proposed targets would have to be reached by 2025 already. With this timescale, building up a sufficiently dense, wide-spread network of recharging and refuelling infrastructure for zero- and low-emission vehicles throughout the Union at the same pace and under the same conditions is now of strong relevance to support the highly necessary accelerated market uptake of zero- and low-emission vehicles. This requires already in the years before 2025, the design and development of Member State plans and measures to deliver on the targets. A new Regulation establishes clearly binding and directly applicable obligations for Member States at national level, </span><span>and</span><span> ensuring their EU-wide coherent and timely application and implementation at the same time. It avoids the risk of delays and inconsistencies in national transposition processes, thus also creating a clear level-playing field for markets, which will help the Union-wide roll-out of recharging and refuelling infrastructure. The Regulation will establish a more robust governance mechanism that tracks Member State progress in achieving the targets and that enables Member States to set the right incentives so that competitive recharging markets can develop. Clear timelines for the design and development of Member States’ national policy frameworks to achieve the targets, robust monitoring and reporting mechanisms, as well as provisions for corrective measures by Member States can enable efficient overall monitoring and steering of efforts in Member States to achieve the targets. This initiative guarantees such an approach.</span>

               <span>Much greater policy ambition for the supply of sufficient and fully interoperable recharging and refuelling infrastructure is necessary to support the needed market take-up of zero- and low-emission vehicles, in line with the overall policy ambition of the ‘Fit for 55’ package and its related policy initiatives. Regulatory fitness is achieved by setting out necessary minimum requirements for public authorities and market actors. The related higher cost to public authorities for supporting infrastructure rollout, particularly in parts of the transport network where demand is low, have to be seen against the backdrop of significantly increased user demand and large-scale opportunities for market growth. The review of policies under the ‘Fit for 55’ policy package will enable the market take-up of zero-emission vehicles and the servicing of vessels equipped with shore-side electricity supply.

Setting clear and common minimum requirements will simplify their business operations, as they will face similar minimum requirements in all Member States. Such requirements will simplify the use of the infrastructure by private and corporate consumers (who currently face a plethora of use approaches) and enable better business service innovation. Consumer trust in the robustness of a Pan-EU network of recharging and refuelling infrastructure will increase, which will support the overall profitability of recharging and refuelling points and support a stable business case. All market actors and user groups will benefit from lower information costs and, in the case of market actors, lower legal compliance costs in the medium term, as the requirements for infrastructure provisioning under the Regulation will be better harmonised.

While the fuel use requirements for the sustainable aviation fuels can largely rely on the existing refuelling infrastructure, investments are needed for the electricity supply of stationary aircraft. The FuelEU maritime initiative sets requirements in particular for the use of on shore power that can only be fulfilled if an adequate level of on shore power supply is deployed in TEN-T ports. However those initiatives do not contain any provisions on the required fuel infrastructure which are a prerequisite that the targets can be met.  </span>

The use of zero-emission powertrain technologies is at different stages of maturity in the different modes of transport. In particular, in the road sector, a rapid uptake of battery-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles is taking place. Hydrogen fuel-cell road vehicles are available to markets, as well. In addition, smaller hydrogen and battery electric vessels and hydrogen fuel-cell trains are currently being deployed in different projects and in first commercial operations, with full commercial roll out expected in the next years. In contrast, the aviation and waterborne sectors continue to be dependent on liquid and gaseous fuels, as zero- and low-emission powertrain solutions are expected to enter the market only around 2030 and in particular for the aviation sector even later, with full commercialisation taking its time. The use of fossil gaseous or liquid fuels is only possible if it is clearly embedded into a clear decarbonisation pathway that is in line with the long-term objective of climate neutrality in the Union, requiring increasing blending with or replacement by renewable fuels such as bio-methane, advanced biofuels or renewable and low-carbon synthetic gaseous and liquid fuels. </span>

They can be technically used with the current vehicle technology with minor adaptations. Renewable methanol can also be used for inland navigation and short-sea shipping. Synthetic and paraffinic fuels have a potential to reduce the use of fossil fuel sources in the energy supply to transport. All of these fuels can be distributed, stored and used with the existing infrastructure or where necessary with infrastructure of the same kind.  </span>

               <span class="num"><span>(7)</span></span><span>LNG is likely to play a continued role in maritime transport, where there is currently no economically viable zero-emission powertrain technology available. The Communication on the Smart and Sustainable Mobility Strategy points to zero-emission seagoing ships becoming market ready by 2030. Fleet conversion should take place gradually due to the long lifetime of the ships. Contrary to maritime transport, for inland waterways, with normally smaller vessels and shorter distances, zero-emission powertrain technologies, such as hydrogen and electricity, should  enter the markets more quickly. LNG is expected to no longer play a significant role in that sector. Transport fuels such as LNG need increasingly to be decarbonised by blending/substituting with liquefied biomethane (bio-LNG) or renewable and low-carbon synthetic gaseous e-fuels (e-gas) for instance. Those decarbonised fuels can be used in the same infrastructure as gaseous fossil fuels thereby allowing for a gradual shift towards decarbonised fuels.  </span>

On the one hand, the common scenarios underpinning the Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy and the Climate Target Plan as well as the revised “Fit for 55” modelling scenarios suggest some limited role of gaseous fuels that will increasingly be decarbonised in heavy-duty road transport especially in the long haul segment. Furthermore, LPG and CNG vehicles for which already a sufficient infrastructure network exists across the Union are expected to gradually be replaced by zero emission drivetrains and therefore only a limited targeted policy for LNG infrastructure deployment that can equally supply decarbonised fuels is considered necessary to close remaining gaps in the main networks.  </span>

               <span class="num"><span>(9)</span></span><span>The deployment of publicly accessible recharging infrastructure for light-duty electric vehicles has been uneven across the Union. Continued uneven distribution would jeopardize the uptake of such vehicles, limiting connectivity across the Union. Continuing divergence in policy ambitions and approaches at national level will not create the long-term certainty needed for substantive market investment. Mandatory minimum targets for Member States at national level should therefore provide policy orientations and complement National Policy Frameworks. That approach should combine national fleet based targets with distance-based targets for the trans-European network for transport (TEN-T). National fleet based targets should ensure that vehicle uptake in each Member State is matched with the deployment of sufficient publicly accessible recharging infrastructure. Distance-based targets for the TEN-T network should ensure full coverage of electric recharging points along the Union’s main road networks and thereby ensure easy and seamless travel throughout the Union.</span>

This requires unique identifiers of relevant actors in the value chain. To that end, Member States should appoint an Identification Registration Organisation (‘IDRO’) for issuing and managing unique identification (‘ID’) codes to identify, at least, operators of recharging points and mobility service providers. The IDRO should collect information on e-mobility ID codes that are already in use in the respective Member State; issue new e-mobility codes, where needed, to recharging point operators and mobility service providers under an Union-wide common agreed logic in which electro-mobility ID codes are formatted; allow to exchange and verify the uniqueness of these e-mobility codes via a possible future common Identification Registration Repository (‘IDRR’). The Commission should issue technical guidance on the set up of such organisation, drawing on the Programme Support Action on “Data collection related to recharging/refuelling points for alternative fuels and the unique identification codes related to e-mobility actors” (‘IDACS’).</span>
