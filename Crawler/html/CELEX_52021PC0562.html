                  <span>By contributing to around 75% of EU external trade volumes and 31% of EU internal trade volumes, maritime transport is an essential component of Europe’s transport system and plays a critical role for the European economy. Every year, around 400 million passengers embark or disembark in EU ports, including around 14 million on cruise ships. Maritime transport fulfils an important role in safeguarding the connectivity of islands and peripheral maritime regions with the rest of the single market</span><span class="FootnoteReference">

               </p>
            </div>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The maritime transport sector operates in an environment of open markets and international competition. Maritime transport services within the EU are open to all EU shipowners, maritime transport services between EU Member States, and between EU Member States and third countries (non-EU countries), can be provided by operators of all nationalities. A level playing field for ship operators and shipping companies is critical to a well-functioning EU market for maritime transport. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>In September 2020, the Commission adopted a proposal to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref3" href="#footnote3">2</a>
               </span><span> and put the EU on a responsible path to becoming climate neutral by 2050. To achieve climate neutrality, a 90% reduction in transport emissions is needed by 2050. All transport modes, including maritime transport, will have to contribute to the reduction efforts.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Achieving significant reductions in CO</span><span>2 </span><span>emissions of international maritime transport requires using both less energy (increasing energy efficiency) and cleaner types of energy (using renewable and low-carbon fuels). The Communication on the 2030 Climate Target Plan</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref4" href="#footnote4">3</a>
               </span><span> explains that: </span><span>“Both the aviation and maritime sectors will need to scale up efforts to improve the efficiency of aircraft, ships and their operations and to increase the use of sustainably produced renewable and low-carbon fuels. This will be assessed in greater detail in the context of the ReFuelEU Aviation and FuelEU Maritime initiatives that aim to increase the production and the uptake of sustainable alternative fuels for these sectors. The necessary technology development and deployment has to happen already by 2030 to prepare for much more rapid change thereafter.” </span>
            </p>
            <div class="border">
               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>Depending on the policy scenarios assessed in the framework of the 2030 Climate Target Plan (CTP) and in support of the Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy, renewable and low-carbon fuels should represent between 6% and 9% of the international maritime transport fuel mix in 2030 and between 86% and 88% by 2050 to contribute to the EU economy-wide GHG emissions reduction targets</span><span class="FootnoteReference">

               </p>
               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>The CTP notes that the renewables share in the transport sector has to increase through the development of electrification, advanced biofuels and other renewable and low carbon fuels as part of a holistic and integrated approach, and that hydrogen based synthetic fuels will be crucial for the decarbonisation in particular in the aviation and maritime sector.</span>
               </p>
               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>The push for the maritime transport sector to use cleaner fuels is also present at international level. In 2018, the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) has adopted its initial strategy on the reduction of GHG emissions from ships. In the list of identified candidate short-term measures, the IMO includes promoting the uptake of alternative low-carbon and zero-carbon fuels and providing shore-side electricity.</span>
               </p>
               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>Currently, the fuel mix in the maritime sector relies entirely on fossil fuels. This can be explained by insufficient incentives for operators to cut emissions and by the lack of mature, affordable, and globally utilisable technological alternatives to fossil fuels in the sector. A number of market failures partly cause and reinforce these problems. These include:</span>

            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The FuelEU Maritime initiative proposes a common EU regulatory framework to increase the share of renewable and low-carbon fuels in the fuel mix of international maritime transport without creating barriers to the single market. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Considerations on possible obstacles to the single market, distortion of competition between operators and diversion of trade routes are particularly relevant to fuel requirements, since fuel costs make up a substantial share of ship operators’ costs. The proportion of fuel costs in the operating costs of ships can range from around 35% of the freight rate of a small tanker to around 53% for container/bulk vessels. Therefore, variations in marine fuel prices may impact significantly the economic performance of ship operators. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>At the same time, the price differential between conventional marine fuels of fossil origin and renewable low-carbon fuels remains high. To maintain competitiveness while still steering the sector towards the fuel transition that it must inevitably undertake, clear and uniform obligations are needed on ships’ use of renewable low-carbon fuels. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>An increased predictability of the regulatory framework is expected to stimulate technology development and fuel production and help the sector unlock the existing chicken-and-egg situation between demand and supply of renewable and low-carbon fuels. Clear and uniform obligations on ship’s use of energy is necessary to mitigate the risk of carbon leakage, which maritime transport is prone to due to its international nature and the possibility to bunker fuel outside the EU. Owing to the cross-border and global dimension of maritime transport, a common maritime Regulation is preferred, over a legal framework requiring EU Member States to turn EU legislation into national law. The latter could result in a patchwork of national measures with differing requirements and targets.</span><span class="CommentReference"> </span>

            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Looking in more detail at the proposed actions, there is currently no mechanism, either at the IMO level or at EU level, to correct for the presence of negative externalities (the indirect costs of emissions that are otherwise not considered) in the sector. This prevents operators from taking into account, in their operational and investment choices, the social cost of their activity in terms of climate change and air pollution. The economic literature indicates pricing mechanisms as the instruments of choice to ‘internalise’ external costs. The main examples would be a tax fixed at the level of the external cost, or a ‘cap and trade’ instrument, such as the EU Emission Trading System (ETS), that sets a limit to the overall emissions and lets the market determine their appropriate price. Both are described as ‘market-based measures’. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>However, while emissions trading can achieve GHG emissions reductions cost‑effectively and provides a uniform price signal that influences decisions of operators, investors and consumers, it does not sufficiently address all barriers to the deployment of low and zero-emissions solutions. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Additional policy actions are needed to ensure that the level playing field in maintained while removing obstacles to investments in clean energy technologies and infrastructure, in turn reducing abatement costs and complementing the action of the EU ETS. This is particularly relevant to support mitigation measures – such as the use of RLF in the maritime transport sector – that have a high potential to reduce emissions in the future but which, presently, face high abatement costs as well as specific market barriers.</span>

            <div class="border">
               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>While extending the EU ETS to the maritime sector will further drive energy efficiency improvements and narrow the price gap between conventional and low-emission technologies, its ability to support the rapid deployment of RLF technologies in the maritime sector strongly depends on its actual price level, which is unlikely to reach sufficient levels for this purpose in the short to medium term.</span>
               </p>
               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>Similarly, legislation dealing with fuel </span><span>supply</span><span> (RED II) and </span><span>infrastructure</span><span> (AFID) has not had a significant impact on the uptake of RLF in the maritime sector and needs to be complemented by measures that are capable of creating a </span><span>demand</span><span> for RLF. In addition, the review of the RED II would not be able to address the high risk of fuel bunkering outside the EU for the shipping sector. </span>

               <span>Maritime transport is an international sector by nature. In Europe, approximately 75% of the voyages reported under the MRV are within the European Economic Area (EEA) (and could therefore be a proxy for intra-EU traffic) and only around 9% of the traffic is estimated to be domestic voyages (between ports within the same EU Member State).

                  <span>Previous EU action on GHG issues has already stimulated a corresponding response from the IMO, notably the EU adopting the Regulation on Monitoring, Reporting and Verification of GHG emissions from ships led shortly afterwards to the IMO adopting a similar mandatory global GHG Data Collection System. A coordinated approach by EU Member States in responding to developments in GHG emission reduction at IMO has more recently ensured that mandatory operational energy efficiency measures are included within IMO’s short term actions to reduce GHG. Projecting a common viewpoint from a considerable group of IMO Member States within the IMO fora means that the EU can have a significant impact on the direction and outcome of IMO discussions.</span>

                  <span>The implementation of this initiative at the EU level is needed to achieve the economies of scale in the uptake of RLFs in maritime transport as well as avoiding carbon leakage, and ensuring level playing field between operators calling in EU ports and between the EU ports themselves. To give an example, obligations established at national level on the use of RLFs could divert traffic to competing ports of other Member States and distort competition. Accordingly, harmonisation at EU level is necessary to ensure a level playing field for all actors of the maritime cluster (in particular, operators, ports and fuel suppliers). </span>

                  <span>The impact assessment established that binding, regulatory measures are necessary to achieve the objectives. A regulation is the most appropriate instrument to ensure common implementation of the measures envisaged, while reducing the risk of distortion within the single market, which could result from differences in how EU Member States turn the requirements in national law. As the transition to RLFs requires significant investments from fuel suppliers, fuel distribution and a strong and clear demand push, it is vital that the regulatory framework provides a single, long-term and robust set of rules to all investors EU-wide. In particular, it is important to avoid creating a patchwork of differing measures at national level, which would be the case if implemented under a cross-sectoral directive.</span>

On policy measures, setting a clear regulatory pathway for decarbonising the current marine fuel received the highest scores from the stakeholders. On geographical scope, there was no obvious preference on the right geographical scope for the measures. In terms of measuring environmental performance and how emissions should be included in the policy framework, most stakeholders prefer a “well-to-wake” approach as that it takes into account not only emissions from the combustion of fuel on board the ship, but also upstream emissions from production, transport, and distribution of fuels. On ships at berth, requirements on the use of on-shore power supply are found to be relevant and necessary for achieving the decarbonisation objectives by most stakeholders.</span>

               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>Policy options provided different ways to design the obligation and differed in particular on their approach to technology choice and the way the required performance is achieved. </span>
               </p>
               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>Policy option 1 is designed as a prescriptive approach, requiring share of specific fuels / fuel types to be used. It implies a technology selection by the regulator. Both policy options 2 and 3 are goal-based approaches, requiring a maximum yearly average GHG intensity limit to be met for the energy used on-board. This leaves the choice of technology to market operators. In addition, policy option 3 contains also mechanisms to reward over-achievers to encourage the development of more advanced, zero-emissions technologies (pooling and multipliers for zero-emission technologies) reducing both air pollutants and greenhouse gases. All options require the most polluting ships in ports (containerships, and passenger ships) to use on-shore power supply (or equivalent zero-emission technology). </span>
               </p>
               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>Following the assessment, policy option 3 is identified as the preferred option as it strikes the best balance between the objectives and the overall implementation costs. It not only answers the needs for flexibility, which have been stressed by stakeholders during the consultation activities (in particular operators and ports), but also reduces the risk of technology lock-in [and incentivises the early adoption of most advanced technologies].</span>

               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>The increased penetration of RLFs in the maritime fuel mix will translate into significant reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution emissions. The related savings in external costs have been estimated at EUR 10bn for air pollution and EUR 138.6bn for climate change, relative to the baseline and expressed as present value for 2021-2050 period. These have been calculated in the impact assessement based on the modelled projected penetration of renewable and low carbon fuels. Savings in the order of EUR 2.3bn are expected to be realised by ship operators due to reduced operating costs (maintenance, crew, etc.). This reduction will be driven by somewhat lower maritime transport activity relative to the baseline. An additional noticeable impact concerned the use of advanced fuels and propulsion technologies, and indirectly the impact it has on innovation. The initiative is expected to boost the penetration of fuel cell-powered vessels (18.9%) in the fleet as well as electric propulsion (5.4%) by 2050 (compared to no penetration of these technologies in the baseline).</span>
               </p>
               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>The main cost resulting from the proposed intervention is borne by ship operators and amounts to EUR €89.7bn. It results from increased capital costs (EUR 25.8bn) and fuel costs (EUR 63.9bn). Indirect costs for the ports will relate to the provision of the necessary bunkering infrastructure and are estimated at EUR 5.7bn. Administrative costs for ship operators are estimated at EUR 521.7m resulting from data collection, submission and verification of the compliance plans and the annual energy report, cooperation during audits and inspections as well as crew training. Additional EUR 1.8m have been identified for the establishment of guidelines by ports to guarantee the safe handling of RLFs. Specific costs related to fuel certification could not be quantified. Enforcement costs for public authorities are expected to be limited (EUR 1.5m) and focus on the provision of the necessary IT reporting tools. The preferred option thus provides net benefits amounting to EUR 58.4bn over the time horizon of the initiative.</span>

At the same time, ship traffic to or from ports in the European Economic Area accounts for some 11% of all EU CO</span><span>2</span><span> emissions from transport and 3-4% of total EU CO</span><span>2</span><span> emissions. 400 million passengers embark or disembark annually in ports of Member States, including around 14 million on cruise ships. Maritime transport is therefore an essential component of Europe’s transport system and plays a critical role for the European economy. The maritime transport market is subject to strong competition between economic actors in the Union and beyond for which a level playing field is indispensable. The stability and prosperity of the maritime transport market and its economic actors rely on a clear and harmonised policy framework where maritime transport operators, ports and other actors in the sector can operate on the basis of equal opportunities. Where market distortions occur, they risk putting ship operators or ports at a disadvantage compared to competitors within the maritime transport sector or in other transport sectors. In turn, this can result in a loss of competitiveness of the maritime transport industry, and a loss of connectivity for citizens and businesses</span>

Accordingly, various complementary policy instruments are needed to motivate the use of sustainably produced renewable and low-carbon fuels, included in the maritime transport sector.

Differences in fuel requirements across Member States of the Union can significantly affect ship operators’ economic performance and negatively impact competition in the market. Due to the international nature of shipping, ship operators may easily bunker in third countries and carry large amounts of fuel. This may lead to carbon leakage and detrimental effects on the competitiveness of the sector if the availability of renewable and low carbon fuels in maritime ports under the jurisdiction of a Member State is not accompanied by requirements for their use that apply to all ship operators arriving at and departing from ports under the jurisdiction of Member States. This Regulation should lay down measures to ensure that the penetration of renewable low-carbon fuels in the marine fuels market takes place under the conditions of fair competition on the EU maritime transport market.</span>

Such  coverage of a share of the energy used by a ship in both incoming and outgoing voyages between the Union and third countries ensures the effectiveness of this Regulation, including by increasing the positive impact on the environment of such framework.  Simultaneously, such framework  limits the risk of evasive port calls and the risk of delocalisation of transhipment activities outside the Union. In order to ensure smooth operation of maritime traffic, a level playing field among maritime transport operators and among ports, and avoid distortions in the internal market, all journeys arriving or departing from ports under jurisdiction of Member States, as well as the stay of ships in those ports should be covered by uniform rules contained in this Regulation.</span>

This will support creating innovative and competitive fuels markets and ensure sufficient supply of sustainable maritime fuels in the short and long term to contribute to Union transport decarbonisation ambitions, while strengthening Union’s efforts towards a high level of environmental protection. For this purpose, sustainable maritime fuels produced from feedstock listed in Parts A and B of Annex IX of Directive (EU) 2018/2001, as well as synthetic maritime fuels should be eligible.

               <span class="num"><span>(12)</span></span><span>Indirect land-use change occurs when the cultivation of crops for biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels displaces traditional production of crops for food and feed purposes. Such additional demand increases the pressure on land and can lead to the extension of agricultural land into areas with high-carbon stock, such as forests, wetlands and peatland, causing additional greenhouse gas emissions and loss of biodiversity. Research has shown that the scale of the effect depends on a variety of factors, including the type of feedstock used for fuel production, the level of additional demand for feedstock triggered by the use of biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels, and the extent to which land with high-carbon stock is protected worldwide. The level of greenhouse gas emissions caused by indirect land-use change cannot be unequivocally determined with the level of precision required for the establishment of emission factors required by the application of this regulation. However, there is evidence that all fuels produced from feedstock cause indirect land-use change to various degrees. In addition to the greenhouse gas emissions linked to indirect land-use change – which is capable of negating some or all greenhouse gas emissions savings of individual biofuels, bioliquids or biomass fuels – indirect land-use change poses risks to biodiversity. This risk is particularly serious in connection with a potentially large expansion of production determined by a significant increase in demand. Accordingly, no feed and food crop-based fuels should be promoted. Directive (EU) 2018/2001 already limits and sets a cap  on the contribution of such biofuels, bioliquids and biomass to the GHG emissions savings targets in the road and rail transport sector considering their lower environmental benefits, lower performance in terms of greenhouse reduction potential and broader sustainability concerns.</span>

The maritime sector has currently insignificant levels of demand for food and feed crops-based biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels, since over 99% of currently used marine fuels are of fossil origin. Therefore, the non-eligibility of food and feed crop-based fuels under this Regulation also minimises any risk to slow down the decarbonisation of the transport sector, which could otherwise result from a shift of crop-based biofuels from the road to the maritime sector. It is essential to minimise such a shift, as road transport currently remains by far the most polluting transport sector and the maritime transport currently uses predominanetly fuels of fossil origin. It is therefore appropriate to avoid the creation of a potentially large demand of food and feed crops-based biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels by promoting their use under this Regulation. Accordingly, the additional greenhouse gas emissions and loss of biodiversity caused by all types of feed and food crop-based fuels require that these fuels be considered to have the same emission factors as the least favourable pathway.</span>
