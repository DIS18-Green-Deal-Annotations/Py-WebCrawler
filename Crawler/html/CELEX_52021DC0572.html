               <span>Forests have long held a hugely important role in our economy and society, creating jobs and providing food, medicines, materials, clean water and more. For centuries, forests have been a thriving hub for cultural heritage and craftsmanship, tradition and innovation. But as important they were in the past, they are essential for our future. Forests are a natural ally in adapting to and fighting against climate change and will play a vital role in making Europe the first climate neutral continent by 2050.  Protecting forest ecosystems also lessens the risk of zoonotic diseases and global pandemics. A healthy future for people, planet and prosperity therefore depends on ensuring healthy, biodiverse and resilient forests across Europe and the world.</span>

To get there, we will have to reverse negative trends, improve monitoring to better capture the state of our forests, as well as step up our efforts to protect and restore forest biodiversity and with that ensure forest resilience.

               <span>Forest management practices that preserve and restore biodiversity lead to more resilient forests that can deliver on their socio-economic and environmental functions. Therefore all forests should be increasingly managed so that they are sufficiently biodiverse, taking into account the differences in natural conditions, biogeographic regions and forest typology. There are significant opportunities for win-win measures, which simultaneously improve forest productivity, timber production, biodiversity, carbon sink function, healthy soil properties and climate resilience. A greater diversity of forest ecosystems and species, and the use of well-adapted genetic resources and ecosystem-based approaches to forest management can enhance long‐term adaptability and forests’ capacity to recover and self-organise. </span>

            <p class="Normal">
               <span>In addition, certain management practices that support biodiversity and resilience, are essential in this context, such as the creation or maintenance at stand and landscape level of genetically and functionally diverse, mixed‐species forests, especially with more broadleaves and deciduous trees and with species with different biotic and abiotic sensitivities and recovery mechanisms following disturbances, instead of monocultural plantations. Also, management practices like uneven-aged and continuous-cover forestry, sufficient quantities of deadwood, regulation of wildlife densities and the establishment of protected habitat patches or set aside areas in production forests help ensure long-term environmental and socio-economic viability of forests. In addition, forest related risk management practices, such as integrated landscape fire management systems will increase forest resilience against wildfires, pests, diseases and create other positive spill over effects. Such practices provide an ‘insurance policy’ and safeguard that forests can continue to provide their full and multifunctional set of goods and services in a variable and uncertain future.</span>

               <span>As to EU policies, the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), through the national Rural Development Programs, already provides financial support for forests and forest management, namely for adaptation and resilience to climate-related risks. In 2014-2020, the CAP forestry measures committed EUR 6,7 billion in support of EU policy targets, mostly for afforestation (27%), prevention of forests fires and disasters (24%) and investments on resilience, ecological and social functions (19%). Yet, the uptake of forestry measures has been low, and decreased substantially along the programming period. This is for example due to the lack of necessary knowledge to manage the administrative procedures to request access to the funds, coupled with insufficient attractiveness of the premium and the lack of capacity building support through advisory services, as well as limited guidance on how to implement forest based adaptation activities and measures to climate change in order to prevent and reduce risks (e.g. wildfires, soil erosion, diseases, floods).</span>

The commitments and actions proposed in this strategy will deliver growing, healthy, diverse and resilient EU forests and ensure their significant contribution to our climate and biodiversity ambitions, thriving livelihoods in rural areas and beyond, and a sustainable forest bioeconomy. The strategic approach to monitoring, decentralised planning and management set out in this strategy will help ensure that forests can deliver on these multiple functions, in full respect for the principle of subsidiarity and Member States’ competence. The strategy recognises the central role of forests, foresters and the entire forest-based value chain for meeting the European Green Deal objectives, and implementation of the strategy will be underpinned by a strong and inclusive governance framework that allows all parties involved to engage and shape the future of forests in the EU. The Commission will ensure that the strategy is implemented in close coherence with other policy initiatives, including those adopted under the European Green Deal and proposals presented as part of the Fit-for-55 package. </span>

               <span>The Commission invites all stakeholders to engage in a broad debate on the future of EU forests. Citizens and communities are encouraged to actively take part in implementing the pledge of planting at least 3 billion additional trees by 2030. The Commission invites the European Parliament and the Council to endorse this strategy. To ensure full political ownership of the strategy, the Commission will suggest a standing progress point at the Council and at the European Parliament. It will review the strategy by 2025 to assess progress and whether further action is needed to meet its objectives.</span>
